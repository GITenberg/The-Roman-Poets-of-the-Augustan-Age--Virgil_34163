                    illustrative of ancient literature, must feel that he owes to you, probably more
                    than to any one else, the impulse which directed him to these studies. It is
                    with this feeling that I should wish to associate your name with this volume.
                    Many of your former pupils can confirm my recollection that one of the happiest
                    influences of our youth was the admiration excited by the union, in your
                    teaching, of perfect scholarship with a true and generous appreciation of all
                    that is excellent in literature. The intimate friendship of many subsequent
                    years has afforded me, along with much else of still higher value, ample
                    opportunities for verifying these early impressions. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This volume has been written in continuation of one which appeared some years
                    ago on the Roman Poets of the Republic. I hope in a short time to bring out a
                    new edition of that work, enlarged and corrected, and afterwards to add another
                    volume which will treat of Horace and the Elegiac Poets. I have reserved for
                    this later volume the examination of the minor poems which have been attributed
                    to Virgil, most of which belong to the Augustan Age. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Besides the special acknowledgments of ideas or information derived from various
                    sources, which are made in notes at the foot of the page where an occasion for
                    them arises, I have to make a general acknowledgment of the assistance I have
                    received in my studies of the Augustan literature from the earlier volumes of
                    Dr. Merivale’s ‘History of the Romans under the Empire,’ from the ‘History of
                    Roman Literature’ by W. S. Teuffel, from M. Sainte-Beuve’s ‘Étude sur Virgile,’
                    and from the Introductions and Notes to Professor Conington’s edition of Virgil,
                    and Mr. Munro’s edition of Lucretius. In the account given of the Alexandrian
                    literature in Chapter I, I have availed myself of the chapters treating of that
                    subject in Helbig’s ‘Campanische Wandmalerei’; in treating of the estimation in
                    which Virgil was held under the Roman Empire, I have taken several references
                    from the work by <span class="tei tei-abbr">S<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">r</span></span>.</span> Comparetti, ‘Virgilio nel Medio Evo’; and in examining
                    the order in which the Eclogues were composed, I have adopted the opinions
                    expressed in Ribbeck’s Prolegomena. I have also derived some 
                    <a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>suggestions from the notes in the edition of Virgil by
                    M. E. Benoist, and from the work of M. G. Boissier, ‘La Religion Romaine
                    d’Auguste aux Antonins.’ As the greater part of this volume was written before
                    the appearance of Dr. Kennedy’s Virgil, I have not been able to make so much use
                    of his notes as I should have wished: I have, however, profited by them to
                    correct or to illustrate statements made before I had seen his work, and, in
                    revising the Virgilian quotations for the press, I have followed his text. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> I did not read Mr. Nettleship’s valuable and original ‘Suggestions Introductory
                    to the Study of the Aeneid’ until I had finished writing all I had to say about
                    that poem. I have drawn attention in the text or in notes at the foot of the
                    page to some places in which I modified what I had originally written after
                    reading his ‘Suggestions,’ to others in which my own opinions are confirmed by
                    his, and to one or two points of divergence in our views. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Since the third chapter was printed off, I have received what seems a
                    confirmation of the opinion expressed there as to the probable situation of
                    Virgil’s early home, from a friend who recently visited the district, where I
                    suppose it to have been. He writes of the country which he passed through—‘The
                    result of my observations perfectly confirms what you had already supposed. The
                    country south of the Lago di Garda for a distance of at least twenty miles is of
                    a gently undulating character, and is intersected by long ranges of hills which
                    gradually sink down towards the lake and the Mincio. The loftiest of these hills
                    may perhaps reach a height of 1000 feet above the lake-level, but that is a
                    point on which I cannot say anything certain.’ </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The only material change which I have made in this edition is that I have added
                    translations of the passages quoted, for the convenience of any readers, who,
                    without much knowledge of Latin, may yet wish to learn something about Latin
                    literature. In the translations from Virgil, I have sometimes made use of
                    expressions which I found in Conington’s prose Translation and in Mr. Papillon’s
                    recently published edition of Virgil. I have also availed myself of Sir Theodore
                    Martin’s Translation of the Odes of Horace. In correcting or supplementing some
                    statements made in the first edition, I have occasionally profited by remarks
                    made in criticisms on that edition which appeared shortly after its publication.

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Augustan Age, regarded as a critical epoch in the history of the world,
                        extends from the date of the battle of Actium, when Octavianus became
                        undisputed master of the world, to his death in the year 14 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> But the age known by that name as a great
                        epoch in the history of literature begins some years earlier, and ends with
                        the death of Livy and Ovid in the third year of the following reign. Of the
                        poets belonging to that age whose writings have reached modern
                        times—Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid—all were born, and
                        some had reached manhood, before the final overthrow of the Republic at the
                        battle of Philippi. The earlier poems of Virgil and Horace belong to the
                        period between that date and the establishment of the Empire. The age of the
                        Augustan poets may accordingly be regarded as extending from about the death
                        of Julius Caesar in 44 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> to the death of Ovid
                        17 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The whole of this period was one of great literary activity, especially in
                        the department of poetry. Besides the writers just mentioned, several others
                        were recognised by their contemporaries as poets of high excellence, though
                        there is no reason to doubt that the works which have reached our time were
                        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span><a name="Pg2" id="Pg2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>most distinguished by original genius
                        and finished execution. These works, though differing much in spirit and
                        character as well as in value, have some common characteristics which mark
                        them off from the literature of the Republic. It seems remarkable, if we
                        consider the short interval which divides the Ciceronian from the Augustan
                        Age, and the enthusiasm with which poetry was cultivated by the younger
                        generation in the years immediately preceding the battle of Pharsalia, that
                        so few of the poets eminent in that generation lived on into the new era.
                        The insignificant name of Helvius Cinna is almost the only poetic link
                        between the age of Catullus and the age of Virgil.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Perhaps, also, the Quintilius whose death Horace laments
                        in the twenty-fourth Ode of Book I. may be the Varus of the tenth poem of
                        Catullus. The more famous name of Asinius Pollio also connects the two eras;
                        but in Catullus he is spoken of, not as a poet, but simply as ‘a youth of
                        wit and graceful accomplishments<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>,’ and in his later career he was more distinguished as a soldier,
                        statesman, and orator than as a poet<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>. It is remarked by Mr. Munro that there are indications that
                        the new generation of poets would have come into painful collision with
                        those of the preceding generation had their lives been prolonged<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>. This spirit of hostility appears in the somewhat contemptuous

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But it is rather in their political feelings and relations, and in the views
                        of life arising out of these, than in the principles and practice of their
                        art, that the new poets are separated from, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name="Pg3" id="Pg3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>antagonistic to, the old. Had Calvus and Catullus survived
                        the extinction of liberty, it would have been impossible for them to have
                        adopted the tone of the poets of the following age. By birth, position, and
                        all their associations and sympathies, they belonged to the Senatorian
                        party. If they could have yielded an outward submission to the ascendency of
                        Julius Caesar and Augustus, they never could have become sincerely
                        reconciled to the new order of things, nor could they have employed their
                        art to promote the ideas of the Empire. On the other hand, L. Varius, the
                        oldest among the poets of the new era, seems first to have become famous by
                        a poem on the death of Julius Caesar. Virgil, in the poem placed first in
                        order among his acknowledged works, speaks of Octavianus in language which
                        no poet of the preceding generation could have applied to a living
                        contemporary: ‘O Meliboeus, it was a God that gave to me this life of ease.’
                        In the Georgics, planned, and, for the most part, composed before the
                        establishment of the monarchy, the person of Caesar is introduced, not only
                        as the centre of power in the world, but as an object of religious
                        veneration; and the national and ethical teaching of that poem is entirely
                        in harmony with the objects of his policy. And, although Horace in the
                        Satires and Epodes, composed between the years 40 and 30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, is so far
                        true to the cause of his youth as to abstain from any direct declaration of
                        adherence to the winning side, yet he attributes to his adviser Trebatius
                        the counsel ‘to celebrate the exploits of the invincible Caesar<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>;’ and his whole relation to
                        Maecenas is one of the most characteristic marks of the position in which
                        the new literature stood to the State and to its leading men. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet, while separated from the literature of the Republic in many of its
                        ideas, and in the personal and political feelings on which it is founded,
                        the poetry of the Augustan Age is, in form and execution, the mature
                        development of the efforts of the previous centuries. Much of its literary
                        inspiration is derived from the age immediately preceding it, and from still
                        older <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg4" id="Pg4" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>native sources. The thought of
                        Lucretius acted upon the mind of Virgil through the force both of sympathy
                        and antagonism, as a strong original nature acts upon one which is at once
                        receptive of influence and possessed of firm convictions of its own. The
                        national sentiment of Ennius and the censorious spirit of Lucilius
                        reappeared in new forms in the Augustan poetry; while the more humane and
                        social feelings, and the enjoyment of beauty in Nature and art, fostered by
                        Greek studies, as well as the taste for less elevated pleasures, stimulated
                        by the life of a luxurious capital, are elements which the poetry of the
                        early Empire has in common with that of the last years of the Republic. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the poetry of the new era has also certain marked characteristics, the
                        result not so much of antecedent as of concomitant circumstances, which
                        proclaim its affinity with great literary epochs of other nations rather
                        than with any period of the national literature. By Voltaire the Augustan
                        Age at Rome is ranked with the Age of Pericles at Athens, that of Lorenzo de
                        Medici at Florence, and that of Louis XIV. in France, as one of four epochs
                        in which arts and letters attained their highest perfection. The affinity
                        between the Augustan Age and those of Pericles and Lorenzo is more
                        superficial than real. They were all indeed periods in which the cultivation
                        of the arts to the highest degree of perfection was fostered by the
                        enlightened patronage of the eminent men who have given their name to their
                        eras. But the position of Augustus, as an absolute ruler, acted more
                        directly and potently, as a modifying and restraining power, on the thoughts
                        and feelings expressed in his age, than that of the leading men of a
                        republic; and the unique position of Rome as the mistress and lawgiver of
                        the civilised world gives to the literature of the Augustan Age an imperial
                        character and interest, which the national literature of no other city or
                        country, even though superior in other respects, can possess. Those who
                        regard all Latin poetry as exotic and imitative have, with some
                        plausibility, attempted to establish a parallel between the Alexandrine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg5" id="Pg5" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>poetry of the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> and that
                        of the Augustan Age. Nor can it be denied that the relation of the Augustan
                        poets to the Emperor was somewhat parallel to that of the scholars and poets
                        of Alexandria to the Ptolemies. The Alexandrine science and literature were
                        also important factors in Roman culture; and the most eminent poets both of
                        the Augustan Age and of that immediately preceding it, with the exception of
                        Horace and Lucretius, acknowledged, in the form as well as the materials of
                        their art, the influence of this latest development of Greek poetry. The
                        nature and amount of the debt incurred to the learned school of Alexandria
                        will be considered later, and it will be seen that it does not seriously
                        affect the originality of the best Roman writers. The age of Queen Anne and
                        of the first George, again, has been called the Augustan Age of English
                        literature. The parallel between the two eras consists in the relation which
                        poets and writers held to men eminent in the State, and also in the finished
                        execution and moderation of tone common to both. The writers of England in
                        our Augustan Age had the advantage over those of Rome in the freedom with
                        which they could express their thoughts; but, even with this advantage, and
                        with the still greater advantage that the English race, in the long course
                        of its literary annals, has given proof of a richer poetical faculty than
                        any other race except the Hellenic, the blindest national partiality would
                        scarcely claim as general and as durable an interest for any poetical work
                        of that era as that claimed for the Georgics and Aeneid of Virgil and for
                        the Odes and Epistles of Horace. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the whole the closest parallel, in respect not so much of the substance
                        and form of composition as of the circumstances and conditions affecting the
                        lives and tastes of poets and men of letters, is to be sought in the age of
                        Louis XIV. of France. The position and the policy of Augustus and of Louis
                        XIV. were alike in some important features. As absolute rulers, the one over
                        a great empire, the other over the most powerful and enlightened nation then
                        existing, they each played the most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg6" id="Pg6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prominent part in history during more than half a century. They were each
                        animated by a strong passion for national and personal glory, and encouraged
                        art and literature, not merely as a source of refined pleasure congenial to
                        their own tastes, but as the chief ornament of their reigns, and as
                        important instruments of their policy. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And not only the political but the purely literary conditions of the two
                        epochs were in some respects parallel. They were both times, not of growth,
                        but of maturity; not so much of the spontaneous inspiration of genius, as of
                        systematic effort directed in accordance with the principles of art and the
                        careful study of ancient models. In each time circumstances and mutual
                        sympathies brought men of letters into close and familiar contact both with
                        one another and with men of affairs and of social eminence. And, while the
                        relation of patronage to literature is not in any circumstances favourable
                        to original invention, and though, except under most advantageous
                        conditions, its tendency is to produce a tameness of spirit, or even an
                        insincerity of tone, yet it has its compensating advantages. It imparts to
                        literature the tone of the world—of the world not only of social eminence,
                        but of practical experience and conversance with great affairs. The good
                        taste, judgment, and moderation of tone which have enabled the Augustan
                        literature to stand successfully the criticism of nineteen centuries, as
                        well as its deficiency in the highest creative power, when compared with
                        such eras as the Homeric Age, the Age of Pericles, and the Elizabethan Age
                        in England, mark the limits of the good influence which this relation
                        between the great in worldly station and the great in genius can exercise on
                        literature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A further parallel might be drawn between the material conditions of the
                        Augustan Age and those of the Age of Louis XIV. The aspect which the world
                        they lived in presented to the writers of the two eras was that of a rich,
                        luxurious, pleasure-loving city, the capital of a great empire or kingdom.
                        And this aspect of the world acts upon the susceptible nature of the poet
                        with both an attractive and a repellent force. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg7" id="Pg7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may feel the spell of outward pomp and magnificence and the
                        attractions of pleasure; or he may be driven back on his own thought, and
                        into communion with Nature, and to an ideal longing for simpler and purer
                        conditions. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, instead of tracing these resemblances further, it is more important to
                        observe that, though the outward influences acting upon the poets of the two
                        eras were in many respects parallel, yet in form and substance the poetry of
                        the Augustan Age is quite different from that of the Age of Louis XIV.
                        However striking the parallel between any two periods of history may at
                        first sight appear, the points of difference between them must be much more
                        numerous than those of agreement: and, though outward conditions have a
                        modifying influence upon national temperament and individual genius, yet
                        these last are much the most important factors in the creative literature of
                        any age. The genius of ancient Italy was, in point of imaginative
                        susceptibility, very different from that of modern France; and, though his
                        countrymen recognise in Racine a moral affinity with Virgil, yet the works
                        these poets have left to the world are as different as they well can be, in
                        form, purpose, and character. The conditions indicated in the comparison
                        between the two periods are to be studied as modifying, not as productive,
                        influences. The forms which the highest spiritual life in an age or an
                        individual assumes, the power of free and happy development which it
                        obtains, or the limitations to which it has to submit, can, to a very
                        considerable extent, be explained by reference, in the case of nations, to
                        the political, social, and material circumstances of the age, and, in the
                        case of the individual, to his early life and environment, his education and
                        personal fortunes. But the quality and intensity of that spiritual force
                        which manifests itself from time to time in the world, giving a new impulse
                        to thought, a new direction to feeling, and a new delight to life, are not
                        to be explained by any combination of circumstances. Yet, just as it is
                        desirable to realise all that can be known of the life and fortunes of an
                        individual poet before endeavouring to extract from his various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg8" id="Pg8" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>works the secret of his power and charm, so it is
                        desirable, before entering on a separate study of the various books which
                        constitute the literature of any age, to take a general survey of the most
                        important conditions affecting the lives, thoughts, and art of all who lived
                        and wrote in that age. In the Augustan Age these conditions may be
                        classified under four heads: (1) the political circumstances of the Empire
                        and the state of moral and religious feeling resulting from them; (2) the
                        social relation of men of letters to men eminent in the State; (3) the
                        wealth, luxury, and outward splendour which met the eye and gratified the
                        senses, in the great city itself, and in the villas scattered over the
                        shores and inland scenes of central Italy; (4) the intellectual culture
                        inherited from the preceding age and modified by the tastes and conditions
                        of the new generation. These will be reviewed as conditions acting on the
                        imagination, and forming the intellectual atmosphere in the midst of which
                        the productions of poetical genius expanded into various shapes and
                        dimensions of beauty and stateliness. </p>

                        disturbances and wars, of confiscations of property, proscriptions and
                        massacres, such as no civilised state had ever witnessed before. The triumph
                        of Augustus secured internal peace and order for a century. The whole world
                        was, as Tacitus says<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>,
                        exhausted, and gladly consented to the establishment of the Empire in the

                        period of suffering. The victors of Philippi, so far from following the
                        example of clemency set to them by the great victor of Pharsalia, had
                        emulated the worst excesses of the times of Marius and Sulla<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>. The poets whose works record the various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg9" id="Pg9" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>phases of feeling through which that age passed
                        had in their own person experienced the consequences of the general
                        insecurity. Virgil, in addition to the loss of his paternal farm, had
                        incurred imminent danger from the violence of the soldier to whom his land
                        had been allotted. The language of Horace indicates that his life had been
                        more than once in jeopardy—at the rout of Philippi, and in his subsequent
                        wanderings by land and sea<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>—till he
                        found himself a needy adventurer, ‘humilem decisis pennis,’ again at Rome.
                        Tibullus lost the greater part of the estates which his ancestors had
                        enjoyed for generations<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>. A similar calamity befell Propertius<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>. Their own experience must thus have deepened the horror of
                        prolonged war and bloodshed natural to men of humane and unwarlike temper,
                        as they all were; for Horace, who alone among them took part in the civil
                        war, describes himself, a few years later, as ‘weak and unfit for war<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>,’ and
                        Tibullus pleads his effeminacy and timidity as a justification of a life
                        devoted to indolent enjoyment<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>.
                        The works of that age, composed between the dates of the battles of Philippi
                        and Actium, express the deep longing of the world for rest: those written
                        later express the deep thankfulness for its attainment. In Virgil the recoil
                        from the cruel and violent passions of the time in which his early manhood
                        was cast draws forth his tender compassion for all human suffering, and
                        creates in his imagination the ideal of a life of peace—‘far from the clash
                        of arms,’ the vision of a place of rest after toil and danger—‘where the
                        fates hold out to us peaceful dwelling-places;’ just as the recoil from the
                        political anarchy of his own age and from the cruel memories of the Marian
                        times deepens the sense of human misery in Lucretius, and forces on his mind
                        the ideal refuge from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg10" id="Pg10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>storms of life in
                        ‘the high and serene temples well bulwarked by the learning of the wise.’ In
                        Horace the feeling of insecurity arising out of his early experience
                        confirms the lessons of Epicurean wisdom, and teaches him not to expect too
                        much from life, but to enjoy thankfully whatever good the passing hour
                        brought to him. In all of them the sense of the real miseries from which the
                        world had escaped, and of the real blessings which it enjoyed after the
                        battle of Actium, induces an acquiescence in the extinction of liberty and
                        in the establishment of a form of government which had been for centuries
                        most repugnant to Roman sentiment. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another influence reconciling men to the great political change which took
                        place in that era was the restored sense of national union. With whatever
                        feelings Octavianus may have been regarded in the early years of the
                        Triumvirate, after the final departure of Antony from Rome he was looked
                        upon both as the main pillar of order and as the champion of the national
                        cause, the true representative of Italy, of the ‘Senatus Populusque Romanus’
                        against the motley hosts of the East, arrayed under the standards of Antony
                        and his Egyptian queen:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With the Romans in the later age of the Republic the feeling of the glory
                        and greatness, the ancient and unbroken tradition, of their State was a more
                        active sentiment than the love of political liberty. The care for the
                        ‘Respublica Romana’ <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg11" id="Pg11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as a free commonwealth
                        was in the last century of its existence confined to the leaders of the
                        Senatorian aristocracy; the pride in the ‘Imperium Romanum’ was a feeling in
                        which all classes could share, and which could especially unite to Rome the
                        people of Italy, who had been admitted too late into citizenship, and were
                        separated by too great a distance from the capital, to make the exercise of
                        the political franchise an object of value in their eyes. They probably felt
                        themselves more truly in the position of equal citizenship after the
                        establishment of the monarchy than before it. This feeling of the pride of
                        empire asserts itself much more strongly in the poets of the Augustan Age
                        than in the writers of the preceding generation. It is scarcely, if at all,
                        apparent in Lucretius and Catullus. It is only in the idealising oratory of
                        Cicero, who, with all his devoted attachment to the forms of the
                        constitution and the traditions of political freedom, still had a strong
                        sympathy with the imperial spirit of Rome, that we find the expression of
                        the same kind of sentiment which suggested to Virgil such lines as <span class="tei tei-q">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The majesty of the State, moreover, impressed the imagination more
                        immediately and more deeply when it was visibly and permanently embodied in
                        a single person than when the administration of affairs and the government
                        of the Provinces were distributed for a brief tenure of office among many
                        competitors. By enabling them to realise the unity and vast extent of their
                        dominion, Augustus reconciled the prouder spirits of his countrymen to his
                        rule, as by restoring peace, order, and material prosperity he enlisted
                        their interests in his favour. At the same time the success of his arms over
                        the still unsubdued tribes of the West, and of his diplomacy in wiping out
                        the stain left on the Roman standards by the disastrous campaign of Crassus,
                        continued to gratify the passion for military glory, without endangering the
                        security and prosperity of Italy. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg12" id="Pg12" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The
                        national sentiment of Rome was further gratified by the maintenance of the
                        old forms of the constitution, by the revival of ancient usages and
                        ceremonies, and by the creation of a new interest in the early traditions of
                        the city, and in the ‘manners and men of the olden time<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>.’ In his
                        brief summary of the glories of the Augustan Age, Horace specifies this
                        return to the ancient ways, ‘by which the Latin name and the might of Italy
                        grew great,’ as one of the best results of Caesar’s administration. The
                        revolution effected in the first century before our era, so far from
                        seeking, as other revolutions have done, abruptly to sever the connexion
                        between the old and the new, strove to re-establish the continuity of
                        national existence. The Augustan Age impressed itself on the minds of those
                        living under it as an era not of destruction but of restoration. Though in
                        the early part of his career Augustus availed himself of the revolutionary
                        passions of his time to overthrow the Senatorian oligarchy, yet he sought to
                        establish his own power on the conservative instincts of society, and
                        especially on the religious traditions intimately connected with these
                            instincts<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>. The
                        powerful hold which these instincts and the feeling of the vital relation
                        subsisting between the past and the present had on the Roman nature was the
                        secret of the great stability of the Republic and Empire. We shall find how
                        largely this sentiment enters into the poetry of the age, how it is
                        especially the animating principle of the great national Epic, as it was of
                        the national commemorative poem of Ennius. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the age witnessed a restoration of the past, not only in its action on
                        the imagination, but in a more direct influence on opinion and conduct.
                        Horace says of it, in the same passage as that referred to above,—‘It put a
                        curb on licence violating all the rules of order, and caused ancient sins to
                        disappear.’ The licence of the previous age in speculation, as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg13" id="Pg13" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in life, had provoked a moral and religious
                        reaction. The idea of a return to a simpler and better life, and of a
                        revived faith in the gods and in the forms and ceremonies of religion,
                        existed at least as an aspiration, if it did not bear much fruit in action.
                        This ideal aspiration finds its expression not only in the two great poems
                        of Virgil, whose whole nature was in thorough harmony with it, who may be
                        regarded almost as the prophet of a new and purer religion, but in many of
                        the Odes of the sceptical disciple of Aristippus. It was part of the policy
                        of Augustus, whether from sincere conviction or as an instrument of social
                        and political regeneration, to revive religion and morality. Among the great
                        acts of his reign commemorated by himself he especially mentions the
                        building and restoration of the temples<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>. The ‘Julian
                        laws’ aimed also at a social and moral restoration. There is no ground for
                        attributing any hypocrisy to Augustus, as a legislator, or to Horace, as his
                        panegyrist, though neither the life of the Emperor nor that of the poet
                        showed a strict conformity with the object of these laws. Yet, if it failed
                        to re-establish the ancient faith in the minds of the educated classes and
                        to restore a primitive austerity of life, this revival affected the best
                        literature of the time by the influence which it exercised on the deeper and
                        more serious feeling of Virgil and the manlier sympathies of Horace, and by
                        imposing at least some restraint on Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid in the
                        record of their pleasures<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The poets with whom our enquiry is concerned, and especially the two most
                        illustrious of their number, thoroughly represent, as they helped to call
                        forth, the spirit in which the Roman world passed through the great change
                        from the Republic to the Empire. They give expression to the weariness and
                        longing for rest, to the revival of Roman and Italian feeling, to the pride
                        of empire, the charm of ancient memories and associations, the aspiration
                        after a better life and a firmer faith. But, further, the expression of
                        these feelings is made subordinate to the personal glory of Augustus, who
                        stands out as the central and commanding figure in all their
                        representations. He is celebrated as the restorer of the golden Saturnian

                        corrupt manners of the State<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>. The sense of gratitude for the rest and prosperity enjoyed
                        under Augustus, the admiration for the real power of intellect and character
                        which made him the most successful ruler that the world has ever seen, the
                        confidence in the unbroken good fortune which marked all his earlier career,
                        may account, without the necessity of attributing any unworthy motive, for
                        the eulogies bestowed upon him as a ruler and organiser of empire. But the
                        language of admiration goes beyond these into a region in which modern
                        sympathies can <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg15" id="Pg15" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with difficulty follow it.
                        Modern criticism may partially explain, but it cannot enable us to enter
                        with sympathy into that peculiar phase of the latter days of Paganism which
                        first appears in the literature and the historical monuments of the Augustan
                        Age as the Deification of the Emperors. In the pages of Tacitus the worship
                        of the Emperor appears as an established ‘cultus,’ as the symbol and the
                        instrument of Roman domination over foreign nations<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>. The cities of Spain vie with
                        the cities of the Asiatic Greeks in their desire to raise temples in honour
                        of the living Emperor. Tacitus seems to regard it as even something
                        discreditable in Tiberius that he disclaims divine attributes<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>. The origin of this ‘cultus,’ as
                        it first established itself in the Greek cities of Asia, may be referred to
                        a survival of the old Greek hero-worship, which led even in the Republican
                        times to the offering of divine honours to Roman Proconsuls and to the
                        excess of the monarchical sentiment among Asiatics, which had led to the
                        worship of the successors of Alexander, and had prompted Alexander himself
                        to claim a divine origin. This foreign vein of feeling united with a native
                        vein,—the strong Roman faith in a secret invisible power watching over the
                        destiny of the State, and revered as ‘Fortuna Urbis.’ This secret invisible
                        divinity became as it were incarnate in the person of the supreme ruler of
                        the world, wielding the whole power, representing the whole majesty of Rome. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The feeling with which the contemporary poets attribute to Augustus a divine
                        function in the world, and anticipate for him a place and high office among
                        the gods after death, is something different from this literal adoration of
                        a living man as invested with the full power and attributes of Deity. But it
                        is difficult to find any rational explanation of the tone adopted by them in
                        such passages as Georg. i. 24–42, or Horace, Ode iii. 3. 11–12. There is,
                        however, a striking coincidence in the manner in which Virgil and Horace
                        suggest the blending of the mortal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg16" id="Pg16" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the
                        immortal, which seems to imply a common source of inspiration. Horace
                        asserts the divinity of Augustus by claiming for him qualities and services
                        equal to, or greater than, those which raised Castor, Pollux, Hercules,
                        Bacchus, and Romulus to the dwelling-place of the gods<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>. Virgil, in one of the cardinal
                        passages of the Aeneid, in which the action is projected into his own age,
                        claims, for the restorer of order then, a vaster range of beneficent
                        influence than that over which the civilising labours and conquests of
                        Bacchus and Hercules had extended<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>. In
                        another passage Horace speaks of the Roman as worshipping the ‘numen’ of
                        Caesar along with the Lares, ‘even as Greece keeps Castor and mighty
                        Hercules in memory<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>.’ In all these
                        passages the idea implied is that, as great services to the human race have
                        in other times raised mortals from earth to heaven, so it shall be with
                        Augustus after the beneficent labours of his life are over<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>. Probably the earliest suggestion of the idea in its
                        manifestation at Rome came from the consecration of Julius Caesar after his
                        death. The ‘Iulium Sidus’—‘the star beneath which the harvest-fields should
                        be glad with corn’—is appealed to both by Virgil and Horace as a witness of
                        the mortal become immortal. As the office of the deified Julius is to answer
                        the prayers of the husbandman, such too will be the office of Augustus; and
                        it is in this relation that he is invoked in the first Georgic among the
                        deities whose function it is to watch over the fields. Both poets recall
                        also the divine origin of the Emperor,—‘Augustus Caesar, of the race of
                        heaven,’—as the descendant of Venus. Both too dwell on the especial
                        protection of which he was the object. The divine care which had watched
                        over Rome from its origin was now centred on him as the supreme head of the
                        State, the heir and adopted son of the great Julius. </p>
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span>
                    <a name="Pg17" id="Pg17" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, although we cannot ascribe to Virgil and Horace the ignorant
                        superstition which raised temples to the living Emperor in the cities of
                        Asia and in the various provinces of the Empire, it is difficult to extract
                        from their language any germ of sincere conviction. And yet to condemn them
                        of a base servility and hypocrisy would be to judge them altogether from a
                        modern point of view. At such a time as the Augustan Age the minds of men
                        were very variously affected by the different modes of religious belief,
                        national and foreign, philosophical and artistic, which had been inherited
                        from the past.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> It must have
                        been difficult for any one to be altogether unmoved by the innumerable
                        symbols of religion visible around him, suggestive of a constant and
                        immediate action of a supernatural power on all human, and especially all
                        national, concerns: and it must have been equally difficult for any one
                        trained in Greek philosophy to accept literally the incongruous fables of
                        mythology, or to attach a definite personality to the imaginary beings of
                        which it was composed. Horace and Virgil appear to stand at opposite
                        extremes of incredulity and faith. Horace, in his Odes, accepts the beings
                        of the Greek mythology as materials for his art, while, by his silence on
                        the subject in his Satires and Epistles, he clearly implies that this
                        acceptance formed no part of his real convictions. To Virgil, on the other
                        hand, the gods of mythology appear to have a real existence, as
                        manifestations of the divine energy, revealed in the religious traditions
                        which connect the actual world of experience with a supernatural origin. So
                        too Horace, in his Odes, treats the blending of the divine with the human
                        elements in Augustus artistically or symbolically—represents him as
                        drinking nectar between Pollux and Hercules, or as inspired with wisdom by
                        the Muses in a Pierian cave—in much the same spirit as the great painters
                        of the Renaissance introduced in their pictures living popes or patrons of
                        art into the company of the most sacred personages. Virgil, to whose mind,
                        in all things affecting either the State or the individual, the invisible
                        world of faith <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg18" id="Pg18" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>appears very near the actual
                        world of experience, seems sincerely to believe in the delegation of
                        supernatural power and authority on the Emperor, and in the favour of Heaven
                        watching over him. The divine energy diffused through all living things
                        might appear to be united with the human elements in Augustus as it was in
                        no other man, so that while still on earth he might be thought of, if not as
                        a ‘praesens divus,’ yet as acting ‘praesenti numine,’ as the representative
                        and vicegerent of omnipotence<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Some further light is thrown on this subject by considering the
                        manifestation of this same spirit in other forms of the art of that age. The
                        famous statue of the Emperor, found recently in the ruins of a villa of the
                        Empress Livia, and at present seen among the statues of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Braccio Nuovo</span></span> in the Vatican, has been critically
                        examined by an eminent German scholar, as furnishing the best commentary on
                        the language of the Augustan poets. In this statue the Emperor appears as
                        blending the attributes of a Roman imperator with those of a Greek hero or
                            demigod.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>
                        Beside him a Cupid, symbolical of the Julian descent from Venus, appears
                        riding on a dolphin. The breast-plate represents, among other protecting
                        deities, those whom Horace addresses in the Carmen Saeculare, Phoebus and
                        Diana, and the Sun and Earth-goddess. In the centre there is a figure of
                        Mars attended by the wolf, receiving back the standards from the Parthian;
                        on either side are seen two figures, representative of races recently
                        conquered, probably the Celtiberians and the tribes of the Alps. From the
                        coincidence of its symbolism it may be inferred that the statue was produced
                        at the same time as the Carmen Saeculare was composed. Its object is to
                        impress on the minds of men the image <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg19" id="Pg19" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
                        Augustus as at once a great earthly conqueror and a being of divine descent
                        and possessed of more than mortal attributes: the especial object of care to
                        the supreme God of Heaven; to Apollo, whom, since the victory of Actium, he
                        claimed as his tutelary divinity; to the Earth-goddess, the giver of
                        fruitfulness and prosperity; to Mars, the second divine ancestor of the
                        Roman race, in whose honour the famous temple, of which the ruins are yet
                        visible, had been raised after the battle of Philippi. The statue is of
                        Greek workmanship; the Greek divinities are presented in the forms familiar
                        to Greek art; but the idea is purely Roman, and born of the immediate
                        circumstances of the age. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Other extant works of art illustrate the divine functions and attributes
                        claimed for Augustus. In one cameo he is seen throned beside the goddess
                        Roma, with the sceptre and lituus, symbolical of his secular and spiritual
                        function, and the eagle of Jupiter at his side. In others both the Emperor
                        himself and various members of his family are represented under the form of
                        gods, goddesses, and demigods. Thus, in one in which the figure of Aeneas is
                        introduced, the young C. Caesar (Caligula) appears as Cupid, and in another
                        Germanicus and Agrippina are represented as Triptolemus and Ceres.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> But still more
                        important, as attesting not the idealising fancies of contemporary Greeks,
                        but the native feeling with which the house of Caesar came to be regarded
                        even in the early years of the Empire, is the one great extant monument of
                        that age, a monument of Roman inspiration and Roman workmanship, the
                        Pantheon, raised by Agrippa in honour of the deities connected with the
                        Julian race. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The prominence given to this representation of Augustus in the poetry and in
                        the art of his age is probably to be explained by his own character and
                        policy. He was animated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg20" id="Pg20" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in no ordinary
                        degree by that love of fame and distinction which very powerfully influenced
                        the greatest Roman conquerors and statesmen, orators and poets. The disdain
                        of such distinctions and the dislike of public spectacles are mentioned, in
                        contrast to the tastes of his predecessor, among the causes of the
                        unpopularity of Tiberius. The enumeration in the Ancyraean inscription of
                        the honours and titles bestowed on him, recorded with ‘imperial brevity’ and
                        dictated by a proud self-esteem, attests the strength of this ruling passion
                        in the latter years of the life of Augustus. The direct pressure which he
                        brought to bear on the most eminent poets of the time to celebrate his wars
                        is sufficiently indicated in many passages in the Odes and familiar writings
                        of Horace. Belonging by descent to the comparatively obscure families of the
                        Octavii and Atii, Augustus attached peculiar importance to the glories of
                        the Julian line, which he inherited through his great-uncle and adoptive
                        father. Even Julius Caesar, notwithstanding his Epicurean disregard of the
                        religious ideas of his age, had encouraged the belief in his divine descent,
                        as marking him out for the special favours of fortune. There was moreover in
                        Augustus, in contradistinction to Julius Caesar, a strong vein of religious
                        or superstitious sentiment. His personal courage has been questioned,
                        probably with injustice, but he appears to have been in a marked degree
                        liable to supernatural terrors<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>. As happens not
                        unfrequently with men who have been invariably successful in great and
                        hazardous enterprises, along with a strong reliance in the resources of his
                        own mind, he seems to have had faith in a supernatural guidance and
                        assistance attending him. His politic understanding appreciated the use of
                        such a belief to secure a divine sanction for his rule, which rested
                        substantially on military force. He availed himself of the enthusiasm and
                        willing services of the poets of the age, who regarded him as at once the
                        saviour of the State and their own benefactor, to impress this idea of
                        himself on the imagination of the cultivated classes, and at the same time
                        to glorify the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg21" id="Pg21" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>actual successes of his
                        reign, to further his policy of national regeneration, and to make men feel
                        the security of a divinely-appointed government, along with the pride of
                        belonging to a powerful imperial State. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The political revolution which transformed the Republic into the Empire, and
                        the state of public feeling, which, arising spontaneously, yet received
                        direction from the will and policy of Augustus, thus appear to be the most
                        important conditions determining the character of the Augustan literature,
                        and distinguishing it from that of the previous age. Poetic art was employed
                        as it had never been in any former time as an instrument of government. If
                        anything could have made the new order of things acceptable to the best
                        representatives of the old Republican traditions, the purity and elevation
                        imparted to the idea of the Empire in the verse of Virgil must have had this
                        effect. The poetical imagination, susceptible as it is in the highest degree
                        of emotions produced by the spectacle of ancient or powerful government or
                        of a people nobly asserting its freedom, has little prophetic insight into
                        the working of political causes. Nor need it be regarded as a sign of
                        weakness or time-serving in the poets of the Augustan Age that they did not
                        foresee the gloom and oppression which were destined to follow so soon after
                        the prosperous dawn of the Roman Empire. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The establishment of the Empire affected the new poetry also by the personal
                        relations which it established between the leaders of society and the
                        leaders of literature. The early Republican poets were for the most part
                        strangers to Rome, men of comparatively humble position, who by their merit
                        gained the friendship of some of the great families, but who at the same
                        time depended for their success on popular favour. The poets of the last
                        days of the Republic were themselves members of the great families, or men
                        intimately associated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg22" id="Pg22" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with them; and they
                        wrote to please themselves and their equals. What remains of their poetry
                        has thus all the independence of the older Republican literature, with the
                        refinement of a literature addressed to a polished society. The poets of the
                        Augustan Age were men born in the country districts or provincial towns of
                        Italy, and the two most illustrious of their number were of humble origin:
                        yet they lived after their early youth in familiar intercourse with the
                        foremost men of their time; they owed their fortunes and position in life to
                        the favour of these men, and thus could not help sharing, and to some extent
                        reproducing, their tastes and tone in their writings. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Among the names of the patrons of literature that of Maecenas has become
                        proverbial, but perhaps even more important than his patronage was that
                        exercised by the Emperor himself. Not only was he a man of great natural
                        gifts, but he had received a most elaborate education. He was a powerful and
                        accomplished orator, and a practised writer<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>. As was
                        not unusual with men who had received a thorough rhetorical training, he
                        attempted the composition of a tragedy, and had the sense to treat his
                        failure with good-natured humour<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>. He
                        made other attempts in verse, and composed several works in prose, chiefly
                        turning on the history of his own times. He showed in his composition an
                        especial regard for purity and correctness of style. Suetonius tells us that
                        he allowed no composition to be written on himself ‘except in a serious
                        spirit and by the best writers.’ Horace testifies to this fastidiousness in
                        the line,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Suetonius testifies further to his liberal patronage of genius; ‘ingenia
                        saeculi sui omnibus modis fovit;’ a statement confirmed by Horace’s account
                        of his liberality to Virgil and Varius,— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> We are told also that in literary works he especially regarded ‘the
                        inculcation of precepts and the exhibition of examples of a useful tendency
                        for the state and for private life,’ which may partly account for the
                        didactic and practical aim which the higher poetry of the age set before
                        itself. He corresponded in terms of intimacy with Virgil, and made repeated
                        advances, which were at first somewhat coldly received, to Horace, with the
                        wish to number him among his familiar friends. But there was another side to
                        the temper of Augustus, which those admitted to his favour did well not to
                        forget. If he could be a liberal patron and genial companion, he could also
                        be a hard and pitiless master. Literature, like everything else, had to be
                        at his command, obedient to his will, and in harmony with his policy. The
                        fate of Gallus, that of Iulus Antonius, and that of Ovid, prove that neither
                        brilliant genius nor past favours and familiarity could procure indulgence
                        for whatever thwarted his purpose or offended his dignity. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The relation between Maecenas and the members of his literary circle was one
                        of more intimacy and unreserve. This circle included among its members
                        Virgil and Varius, Horace and Propertius. The great works with which the
                        name of Maecenas is inseparably associated,—the Georgics of Virgil, the
                        first three books of the Odes of Horace, and the first book of his
                        Epistles,—entitle him to be honoured as among the most enlightened and
                        fortunate of all the patrons of literature. Virgil addresses him in language
                        not only of loyal admiration, but of acknowledgment for the encouragement
                        and guidance which he owed to him: and that such an influence may have been
                        really exercised by the inferior over the superior mind is shown <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg24" id="Pg24" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by the testimony given by Goethe of the stimulus
                        which his genius derived from the encouragement of the Duke of Weimar<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a>.
                        Horace writes of Maecenas in the language not only of admiration and
                        gratitude, but of warm and disinterested affection; and the favour shown to
                        Propertius, a poet of a very opposite type, shows that his appreciation of
                        genius was not limited by a narrow partisanship. His character seems to have
                        left very different impressions on the minds of his contemporaries,
                        according as they knew him intimately or merely from the outside. It is a
                        proof of his capacity and his loyalty<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> that he was the one man thoroughly trusted by Augustus in
                        all affairs of state, as Agrippa was in war: and that his qualities of heart
                        were no less admirable appears not only from the poetical eulogies in the
                        Georgics, the Elegies of Propertius, and the Odes of Horace, but also from
                        the more natural tribute to his worth as a man and his sincerity as a friend
                        contained in Horace’s Satires and Epistles. On the world outside his own
                        immediate circle he produced the impression of an effeminate devotion to
                        pleasure. His love of pleasure and his shrinking from death seem to be
                        confirmed by the testimony of Horace:— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sketch of him by Velleius Paterculus presents the view of his character
                        suggested by the contrast between his ability as a statesman and the
                        apparent indolence of his private life: ‘A man, who, while in all critical
                        emergencies displaying sleepless vigilance, foresight, and capacity for
                        action, yet, during intervals of relaxation, was in his indolent
                        self-indulgence almost more effeminate than a woman<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>.’ It is remarkable that Tacitus ascribes a
                        similar character to the man in whom, after the death of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg25" id="Pg25" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Maecenas, Augustus most confided—Sallustius
                            Crispus<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>. Perhaps the position of Maecenas,
                        as the trusted confidant of a jealous and imperious master, required him to
                        begin his career by playing a part which afterwards became habitual to him.
                        Among the traits of his character indicated by Horace are knowledge of men,
                        reticence, and indifference to the outward distinctions of birth and rank.
                        Whatever ambition he had was to exercise real power as the minister of
                        Augustus, not to enjoy official titles. He certainly used his position to
                        direct the genius both of Virgil and Horace to public objects. There is no
                        reason to doubt the fact noticed in the Life of Virgil, that he influenced
                        him in the choice of the subject of the Georgics with the view to revive the
                        chief among the ancient arts, ‘by which the Latin name and the strength of
                        Italy had grown great.’ But it was with Horace that he shared all his public
                        interests and private feelings, and it is not a very hazardous conjecture to
                        presume that many of the Odes and familiar writings of the latter poet
                        reflect the tastes and sentiments of Maecenas, perhaps give back the very
                        style and manner of his conversation. The alternation observable in the Odes
                        of Horace between an apparent devotion to the lighter themes of lyrical
                        poetry and the serious interest in great affairs, the irony disclaiming all
                        lofty and austere pretension, the Epicurean taste for simplicity combined
                        with the Epicurean love of pleasure, the indifference to outward state, and
                        the urbanity and knowledge of the world, more conspicuous in Horace than in
                        any other ancient poet, are suggestive of habitual contact with the worldly
                        wisdom, the real power disguised under an appearance of carelessness, the
                        refined enjoyment of life, the genial social nature, which were not only a
                        great power in the State, a great charm in the life of a by-gone age, but
                        have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg26" id="Pg26" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>through their action on the literature
                        of the time become a permanent and beneficent influence on human culture. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Other names of men eminent among the ‘lights and leaders’ of the time are
                        also intimately connected with its literature. The earliest patron by whom
                        Virgil’s genius was recognised was not Maecenas but Asinius Pollio, who in
                        his early youth had lived in the gay circle of Catullus; who, as the
                        lieutenant of Antony, had governed the province of Cisalpine Gaul; who had
                        filled the office of Consul, commanded an army, and obtained a triumph; who
                        is mentioned by Horace in one of his early Satires as among the few critics
                        whose appreciation he valued; who in later life obtained great distinction
                        as an orator; to whose talent as a writer of tragedy both Virgil and Horace
                        bear witness; who undertook the composition of a work the loss of which is
                        one of the most irreparable gaps in historical records—a contemporary
                        History of the Civil Wars ‘ex Metello consule;’—and who performed the
                        important service to literature of being the first to establish a public
                        library at Rome, and the more questionable service of instituting the
                        practice of public recitations. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> M. Valerius Messala, the next in importance among the patrons of letters,
                        unlike Maecenas and Pollio, who, though of old provincial families, were
                        ‘novi homines’ at Rome, was a representative of one of the oldest and most
                        illustrious patrician houses. He had held high command in the Republican
                        army at Philippi, and was distinguished as an orator, an author, and patron
                        of literature. He became the centre of a literary circle the most brilliant
                        member of which was Tibullus; which, though living in friendly relations
                        with the circle of Maecenas, did not share with it the enthusiasm for the
                        new <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">régime</span></span>. Men like Pollio and Messala are important
                        as elements contributing to the general taste and culture of the age, but
                        not as determining the political or ethical character stamped upon the
                        literature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No direct literary influence was exercised by Agrippa, who is described by
                        the elder Pliny as ‘A man, whose manners more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg27" id="Pg27" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nearly approached rustic plainness than refinement of
                        taste;’ but his military and naval successes, and still more the great works
                        of utility and beauty erected under his superintendence, contributed to the
                        same end as the poetry of Virgil and Horace, that of perpetuating the spell
                        of the name of Caesar upon the imagination of the world. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cornelius Gallus, like Pollio, was eminent both in action and in poetry, but
                        his brilliant and erratic career was cut short too soon to enable him to
                        obtain a foremost place either among poets or among literary patrons. Yet an
                        undying interest attaches to his name from the evidence afforded in the
                        Eclogues of his being the first and apparently the only one who inspired in
                        Virgil that affection, partly of the heart, partly of the imagination, which
                        fascinates and attaches the finer nature of the poet to the stronger or
                        bolder nature of one in whom it recognises some ideal of heroism, combined
                        with the qualities which unite men in friendship with one another. It is of
                        Gallus alone that Virgil writes in such a strain as this:— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> and it is to Gallus that he assigns the pre-eminence in his own especial
                        province of poetry,—as he represents the shepherd-poet Linus presenting him
                        with the reeds which the Muses had of old given to ‘the sage of Ascra<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Odes of Horace, addressed to men of high official station and ancient
                        family, such as Sestius, Munatius Plancus, Sallustius Crispus, Aelius Lamia,
                        Manlius Torquatus, still further illustrate the close connexion between the
                        great world and the world of letters. His later Epistles, many of which are
                        addressed to young men of rank devoting themselves to literary studies and
                        pursuits, attest the continuance of the same tendency as time went on. And
                        in the following generation Ovid and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg28" id="Pg28" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his
                        contemporaries enjoyed the favour and friendship of the sons of these men
                        and of other illustrious patrons. Juvenal, in the Satire in which he
                        complains of the absence of a liberal patronage in his own age, unites the
                        names of Fabius and Cotta Messalinus (son of Messala), whose protection and
                        encouragement Ovid had enjoyed, with that of Maecenas<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>. The chief cause of this close bond of union between
                        social rank and literary genius was the fact that the men who in a former
                        age would, from their birth and education, have had a great political career
                        before them, were now debarred from the highest sphere of active life; while
                        they were not yet, what they became under the systematic corruption of the
                        later Caesars, too enervated and demoralised to continue susceptible of the
                        nobler kinds of intellectual pleasure. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Probably in no other aristocratic or courtly society has there been so large
                        a number of men possessing the ability and knowledge, the accomplishments
                        and leisure, required for the appreciative enjoyment of a literature based
                        on so fine and elaborate a culture. There are some circumstances which made
                        the patronage of the earlier half of the Augustan Age more favourable to
                        letters than that of other periods in which the same influence has been
                        exercised. The chief literary patrons then were men who had played a
                        prominent part in a revolutionary era,—men indeed of ancient birth or
                        hereditary distinction, yet owing their pre-eminence to their talent,
                        energy, and aptitude for the time, and thus open to new influences, and free
                        from the prejudices of an old-established nobility. They had the culture and
                        careful education of an aristocratic class, combined with the liberal
                        tendencies of revolutionary leaders. The distance which in the preceding age
                        would have kept apart men born into a high social and political position
                        from men of genius of humble origin was easily passed in a time immediately
                        succeeding that in which the great C. Julius had practically proclaimed the
                        doctrine of ‘an open career to every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg29" id="Pg29" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kind
                        of merit.’ Among the liberal traits in the character of Maecenas, as painted
                        by Horace, the indifference to distinctions of birth is specially marked:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The new men at the court of Augustus were naturally attracted to the new men
                        in literature, sprung from quite a different class from that to which
                        Lucretius, Catullus, or Calvus belonged, and yet, in respect of education,
                        refinement, and even early associations, in no respect their inferiors. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another bond of union between them was that they were nearly all of the same
                        age, born with one or two exceptions between the years 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, and 60 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, and
                        that several of them had studied under the same masters. The distinguished
                        men of the Ciceronian Age had passed away, with the exception of one or two,
                        such as Varro and Atticus, living in retirement, and consoling themselves
                        with their farms and libraries for the changes they had witnessed. The
                        leaders in action, as in literature, were all young men, beginning their
                        career together in an altered world, the characters and destinies of which
                        they were called upon to mould. One by one they dropped away, most of them
                        before passing the period of middle life, leaving the Emperor almost the
                        sole survivor among a younger generation who had grown up under the new
                        order of things, and, while acquiescing in it as complacently, sharing
                        neither in the energy nor in the enthusiasm of the early years (from about
                        27 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> to about 10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>) during which the Empire left its greatest and happiest
                        impression. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This relation of men of letters to the leaders of society under the Empire
                        could not but exercise a strong influence both for good and evil on the
                        literature of the age. Such a society,—able, versed in affairs,
                        accomplished, fond of pleasure,—whatever <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg30" id="Pg30" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>else it may be, is sure to be characterised by good sense, a strong
                        feeling of order and dignity, an acute perception of propriety in conduct
                        and manners, an urbanity of tone restraining all arrogant self-assertion and
                        violent animosity of feeling. Such a society is the determined enemy of all
                        pedantry, eccentricity, and exaggeration, of all austerity or indecorum, of
                        one-sided enthusiasm or devotion to a single idea. The ‘aurea mediocritas’
                        in feeling, conduct, thought, and enjoyment is the ideal which it sets
                        before itself. Horace, except in his highest and most thoughtful moods, is
                        the true representative of such a society; but its indirect influence may be
                        noted also in the moderation, the invariable propriety and dignity, both of
                        thought and language in Virgil, and in the tones of refinement with which
                        Propertius and Ovid record the experience and preach the philosophy of
                        pleasure. Yet literature probably lost as much from the limitation of
                        sympathy imposed upon it as it gained from this acquired dignity and
                        urbanity of tone. The Roman poets of this era, even while expressing
                        national sentiments and ideas, were not like Homer, Pindar, or Sophocles,
                        who, while putting a sufficiently high value on distinctions of birth and
                        fortune, and on the personal qualities accompanying these distinctions, are
                        yet, in a sense in which the poets of the Augustan Age are not, the poets of
                        a whole people. Horace introduces that series of his Odes which most
                        breathes a national spirit by disclaiming all sympathy with the ‘profanum
                        vulgus.’ He looks upon it as one of the privileges of genius, ‘to scorn an
                        ill-natured public.’ He did not wish his Satires to be thumbed by the
                        multitude or by men of the class of Hermogenes Tigellius. He cared only for
                        the appreciation of men belonging to the class in which all culture and
                        regard for the traditions of Rome were now centred. The urban populace, as
                        represented in literature, appears only as a rabble,—and this is still more
                        the case in the days of Juvenal,—which had to be kept in order, fed,
                        amused, and tended, like some dangerous wild beast. The middle class,
                        absorbed in money-making and commercial adventure, supplies to Horace <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg31" id="Pg31" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the representatives of the misers and
                        parvenus whom he painted in his Satires for the amusement of his
                        aristocratic readers. The tone of Virgil is equally anti-popular. The view
                        of society which he delights to present is that of a paternal ruler giving
                        laws to his people and caring for their welfare. His repugnance to the
                        influence of the ‘popularis aura’ on government is indicated in such
                        passages as the famous simile near the beginning of the Aeneid, </p>

                        tended to make literature tamer in spirit and thought, perhaps also less

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The great wealth and luxury of Rome, during the latter years of the Republic
                        and the early years of the Empire, exercised also an influence on the life,
                        the imagination, and the thoughts of the poets living in those times.
                        Through commerce and conquest Rome had entered into the possession of the
                        long accumulated wealth of the world, and, as generally happens in eras of
                        advanced civilisation, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg32" id="Pg32" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enjoyment of
                        these was very unequally distributed. Nothing appears more remarkable in the
                        social life of the latter days of the Republic than the great riches
                        possessed and expended by a few individuals, such as Crassus, Hortensius,
                        and the Luculli. One proof of the immense accumulation of money at that time
                        is the large price which, as we learn from Cicero’s letters, was paid for
                        the houses of the leading men among the nobility. The number of villas
                        possessed by Cicero himself, the son of a provincial Eques, and debarred by
                        stringent laws (though probably they were evaded) from turning his
                        pre-eminence as an advocate to profit, and the sums spent by him in their
                        adornment, suggest to us to what an extent the soil of Italy, the works of
                        Greek art, and the natural and artificial products of the East, were at the
                        disposal of the ruling aristocracy of Rome. Still more is this thought
                        forced on us when we think of Proconsuls and Propraetors who came home
                        glutted with the spoils of their provinces, which they squandered in the
                        coarsest luxury. The change to the Empire, though it put a considerable
                        check on this kind of plunder, did little to distribute wealth more
                        generally, or to limit luxurious living. The appropriation during the Civil
                        Wars of the sacred treasures long accumulated in the temples of the
                            gods<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>, and the
                        great stimulus given to commerce by the establishment of peace, added
                        largely to the wealth available at Rome for purposes of munificence, of
                        ostentation, or indulgence. But the largest share in the disposal of the
                        wealth of the world had passed from the representatives of the old governing
                        class to the ruling powers of the new Empire, and this change was decidedly
                        for the public advantage. Augustus and his ministers possessed the old Greek
                        virtue of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">μεγαλοπρέπεια</span></span>, and understood that immense wealth could
                        be better expended on great public objects than on beautifying their villas
                        and fish-ponds, or giving a more dangerous variety to their entertainments.
                        The policy of Augustus in restoring and building the temples of the gods had
                        an artistic as well as a religious purpose. He wished <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg33" id="Pg33" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to make his countrymen proud of the outward beauty of Rome,
                        as Pericles had made the Athenians proud of the beauty of Athens. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The most enduring result of this munificence, more enduring even than the
                        noble ruins of temples and theatres—the visible monuments preserved from
                        that age—is the finished art of the verse of Virgil and Horace. By the
                        liberality of the Emperor, Virgil was able to devote to the composition of
                        his two great works nearly twenty years of ‘unhasting and unresting’ labour
                        in the beautiful scenery of Campania. The wealth and lands at the disposal
                        of Maecenas enabled Horace to change the wearisome routine and enervating
                        pleasures of Rome for hours of happy inspiration among the Sabine Hills or
                        in the cool mountain air of Praeneste, amid the gardens and streams of Tibur
                        or by the bright shores of Baiae<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a>. To the liberality of their patrons these poets owed not only the
                        leisure and freedom from the ordinary cares of life<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>, which allowed them to give all their thought and the
                        unimpaired freshness of their genius to their art, but the opportunity of
                        enjoying under the most favourable circumstances that source of happiness
                        and inspiration which has given its most distinctive charm to their
                        poetry—the beauty of Italian Nature. It is only in their appreciation of
                        the living beauty of the world for its own sake (and apart from divine or
                        human associations) that the great Roman poets possess an interest beyond
                        that of the poets of any other age or country, with the exception of the
                        English poets of the present century. Nowhere is the familiar charm of a
                        well-loved spot suggested in truer and more graceful words than these:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The literature of the Augustan Age has often been compared with that of
                        England in the first half of the eighteenth century. In so far as each
                        literature is the literature of town life, in so far as it has a moral and
                        didactic purpose, the comparison holds good. The Satires and Epistles of
                        Horace present a parallel both to the poetical Satires of Pope, which in
                        outward form are imitated from them, and still more to the prose Essays of
                        the Spectator. They resemble those Essays in their union of humour and
                        seriousness, in the use they make of character-painting, anecdote, and moral
                        reflection, in the justice and at the same time the limitation of their
                        criticism both on life and literature, in the colloquial ease combined with
                        the studied propriety of their style. But while Horace, in addition to his
                        powers as a moralist and painter of character, ranks high among those poets
                        who enable us to feel the secret and the charm of Nature, latent in
                        particular places, the only period <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg35" id="Pg35" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
                        English literature from which this power is absent is that of which Addison
                        and Pope are among the chief representatives. A similar superiority in this
                        respect may be claimed for the Augustan poetry over that of the Age of Louis
                        XIV. As was said before, French criticism points to Racine as a genius with
                        a certain moral affinity to Virgil; but it equally acknowledges his
                        inferiority as the interpreter of Nature. ‘C’est cet amour,’ says M.
                        Sainte-Beuve, ‘cette pratique de la nature champêtre qui a un peu manqué à
                        notre Racine, dont le goût et le talent de peindre ont été presque
                        uniquement tournés du côté de la nature morale.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ease of their circumstances and the fact that they owed this ease to
                        others (‘Deus nobis haec otia fecit’) have impressed themselves in other
                        ways on the character of the Augustan poetry. The spirit of that poetry is
                        certainly tamer than that of other great literary epochs. Even the enjoyment
                        of Nature is a passive rather than an active enjoyment derived from
                        adventurous or contemplative energy. There is no suggestion, as there is in
                        Homer and in many modern poets, of vivid contact with the sterner forces of
                        Nature. The sense of discomfort as well as of danger was then, as it has
                        been till the present century, sufficient to repress the imaginative love of
                        the sea or of mountain scenery<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>. Horace expresses a shrinking from the dangers of the
                        sea, nor is there in Virgil any trace of that enjoyment of perilous
                        adventure which is one of the great sources of delight in the Odyssey. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The profuse expenditure and luxury of the age called forth in its poets a
                        spirit of reaction to a simpler and more primitive ideal, as they did in the
                        French literature of the latter part of the eighteenth century. By contrast
                        with the unreal enjoyment of luxury and the ennui occasioned by it, which
                        Lucretius had satirised in the previous generation, a stronger sense of the
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg36" id="Pg36" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>purer sources of human enjoyment, of
                        friendly and intellectual society, of family affection, of the beauty of
                        Nature, of the simpler tastes of the country, was awakened even in those who
                        in their actual lives did not realise all these sources of happiness. But in
                        Horace this feeling of contrast does not express itself in the tones of
                        vehement antagonism which appear a century later in Juvenal. Luxury and
                        profuse expenditure are indeed repugnant to his taste, and they suggest to
                        him, as they do to Virgil, the purer enjoyment of simple living. There is no
                        doctrine which Horace preaches more constantly in all his works, or with
                        more apparent sincerity, than that of being independent of fortune, and of
                        the greater happiness enjoyed in the mean station in life between great
                        wealth and poverty. Yet, while preaching the same doctrine, he does not
                        express it in terms of such deep and earnest conviction as the </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> of Lucretius. In at least the earlier part of his poetic career he had had
                        his share of the luxurious living and the other pleasures of Roman life.
                        Experience had satisfied him that the ‘slight repast, and sleep on the grass
                        by a river’s side<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>,’ contributed
                        more to his happiness in later life than drinking Falernian from midday; and
                        as years went on, it gave him more pleasure to recall the memory of his old
                        loves in song than to involve himself in new engagements. The Horatian
                        maxims in favour of simplicity have this recommendation, that they are the
                        result of experience in both ways of living. The luxurious life of the
                        capital seems at no time to have possessed charms for Virgil or Tibullus.
                        Though the latter was a man of refinement, and not averse to pleasure, yet
                        he has a feeling similar to that of Rousseau in favour of an ideal of
                        rudeness and simplicity as compared with the pomp and profusion of life in
                        Rome. The more active and energetic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg37" id="Pg37" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>temperament of Propertius and of Ovid induced them to participate with
                        less restraint in the pleasures of the city, and they appealed to congenial
                        tastes among their contemporaries in the choice of the topics treated in
                        their poems. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The conditions hitherto considered enable us to appreciate the prominence
                        given to national and imperial ideas in the literature of the Augustan Age,
                        and also to understand the chief differences in tone and spirit between that
                        literature and the literature of the Ciceronian Age. Along with these marked
                        differences, obvious points of agreement are also observable. The cultivated
                        men of each time had the same refined enjoyment in Nature, art, literature,
                        and social life. And in turning to the intellectual conditions affecting
                        literary form and style, the later period will be seen to be still more
                        closely connected with the earlier. The golden age of Latin poetry,
                        commencing in the years preceding the overthrow of the Republic, reaches its
                        maturity in the earlier part of the reign of Augustus, and then begins to
                        decline, till under Tiberius the last poetic voice is silenced. Though Latin
                        prose-literature had yet to be enriched by some of its greatest and most
                        original works, yet neither the glory of the Empire, the charm of the
                        Italian life, nor the vivifying ideas and creations of Greek genius were
                        ever again able to revive the genuine poetical inspiration which ancient
                        Italy once, and once only, enjoyed in abundant measure. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The half-century from about 60 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> to about 10
                            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> was, at once, one of those rare and
                        germinative epochs in the history of the world, in which a powerful
                        intellectual movement coincides with, influences, and is influenced by a
                        great movement and change in human affairs; and it was at the same time a
                        period of a rich and elaborate culture, in which the inheritance of Greek
                        genius, art, and knowledge came for the first time into the full possession
                        of the Romans. The earlier half of this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg38" id="Pg38" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>period was more distinguished by original force of mind, the latter half
                        by more complete and perfect culture. The age of Cicero was one of great
                        energy in the chief provinces of human activity—in war and politics, in
                        oratory, poetry, and philosophy. There is no intellectual quality so
                        characteristic of his own oratory, of the poetry of Lucretius, of the
                        military and political genius of Julius Caesar, as the ‘vivida vis,’—the
                        energy, at once rapid and enduring in its action, as of a great elemental
                        force. Among their contemporaries, though there was no man of high political
                        capacity, yet there was a many-sided intellectual activity manifesting
                        itself in the forum and senate-house, in social intercourse and
                        correspondence, and in varied literary and philosophical discourse. As a
                        result of this novel activity of mind, the Latin language developed then for
                        the first time all its resources as a powerful organ of literature, inferior
                        indeed to the language of Greece in the days of its purity, but much
                        superior as the instrument of poetry and oratory, history and philosophy, to
                        that language in its decay<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>. The writers of the Augustan Age received
                        this language from their predecessors, in its most sensitive period of
                        growth, while able to present to the mind in unimpaired freshness the
                        immediate impressions from outward things and from the inner world of
                        consciousness, but still capable of more delicate and varied combinations to
                        fit it to become the perfectly harmonious organ of sustained poetical
                        emotion. This further development was given to it by the Augustan poets, but
                        not without some loss of native force and purity of idiom. They too felt the
                        influence of the strong intellectual movement of the preceding age. But it
                        came upon their minds with a less novel and vehement impulse. They are
                        greater in execution than in creative design. They are more concerned with
                        the results than with the processes of thought. Virgil may have been as
                        assiduous a student of philosophy as Lucretius, but he does not feel the
                        same need of consistency of view and firmness of speculative conviction; he
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg39" id="Pg39" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shares with Lucretius the strong
                        passion for poetry (‘dulces ante omnia Musae’), but neither he nor Horace,
                        though each recognises the supreme claims of philosophy, shows the passion
                        for enquiry which induced Lucretius </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The master-pieces of the Augustan literature were not the products of that
                        vivid and rapidly-working creative energy which marked the Ciceronian Age.
                        There never was an age in which great writers trained themselves so
                        carefully for their office, strove so much to conform to recognised
                        principles of art, reflected so much on the plan and purpose of their
                        compositions, or used more patient industry in bringing their conceptions to
                        maturity. The maxim ‘nonum prematur in annum’ illustrates the spirit in
                        which the great artists of that age worked. The cultivated appreciation of
                        Greek art and poetry—the essential condition of the creative impulse of
                        Italy—then reached its highest point, produced its supreme effect in a
                        national Roman literature of similar perfection of workmanship, and, after
                        that, rapidly declined and passed away from the Roman world as a source of
                        literary inspiration, leaving however the educating influence of this new
                        literature in its place. The Greek language had indeed been studied at Rome
                        for nearly two centuries before the Ciceronian Age. The earliest Roman
                        writers—Naevius, Ennius, Pacuvius, etc.—had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg40" id="Pg40" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>used the epic and dramatic poetry of Greece as a kind of
                        quarry for their own rude workmanship. The age of Laelius had imbibed much
                        of the humanity and wisdom of Greek speculation. But it was not till the age
                        of Cicero and Catullus that the long process of education and the largely
                        increased intercourse between the two nations had raised the Roman mind to a
                        full sense and enjoyment of artistic excellence, as revealed both to the eye
                        and to the mind. The men of that age, in the midst of all their active
                        pursuits, were moved by this foreign influence as the men of the Renaissance
                        were moved by the recovery of classical literature. In the case of some
                        among them the passion for accumulating books and works of art became the
                        absorbing interest in their lives. Though in some of the orators and men of
                        letters, e.g. Memmius, as we learn from Cicero, their Greek tastes fostered
                        an affected indifference to their own nationality, yet on the best minds,
                        such as those of Cicero himself, Lucretius, and Catullus, this intimate
                        contact with Greek genius acted with a vivifying power by calling forth the
                        native genius of Italy. It was the peculiarity of the Roman mind to be
                        capable of receiving deep and lasting impressions from other nations with
                        whom it came in contact, without sacrifice of the strong individuality of
                        its own character. What Columella says of the Italian soil, ‘that it is most
                        responsive to the care bestowed on it, since, through the energy of its
                        cultivators, it has learned to yield the products of nearly the whole
                            world<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>,’ might be said with equal truth
                        of the Italian mind. This adaptability to foreign influences, without loss
                        of native genius and character, enabled Rome to exercise spiritual supremacy
                        over the world for more than a thousand years after the loss of her temporal
                        supremacy. In the age of Cicero and the following age this adaptability to
                        another form of spiritual influence gave to Rome a great national
                        literature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil, Horace, and their immediate contemporaries devoted themselves to
                        Greek studies with even more ardour than their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg41" id="Pg41" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>immediate predecessors. Education and preparation for a
                        career in literature was a more elaborate process than it had ever been
                        before, perhaps we might add, than it has ever been since. Virgil was still
                        an unknown student, carefully preparing himself for the labour of his life
                        almost till he reached the age at which Catullus died. Horace at the age of
                        twenty-three was, to use his own words, still ‘seeking for the truth among
                        the groves of Academus.’ The taste for literary leisure was greatly
                        developed among the educated classes by the suppression of all active
                        political life; while at the same time the establishment of public libraries
                        made the access to books more easy and general. Women equally with men made
                        themselves familiar with at least the lighter fancies of the learned Greeks.
                        There are none of his Odes into which Horace is so fond of introducing his
                        mythological allusions as those in which some real or fictitious heroine,
                        Galatea or Asterie, Lyde or Phyllis, is addressed. The poems of Propertius
                        which celebrate his love for Cynthia could only be appreciated by the
                        possessors of much recondite learning. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Though the greatest poets of the Augustan Age drew much of their inspiration
                        from the purer sources of Greek genius, especially from Homer and the early
                        lyric poets, yet the period of Greek literature which was most familiar to
                        the Romans of the Augustan Age was the Alexandrian. It was nearest to them
                        in point of time; it was most congenial to the taste of the learned Greeks
                        who now gathered from the widely-scattered centres of Greek culture to Rome,
                        as they had formerly done to Alexandria; it was of all the forms of Greek
                        literature the most cosmopolitan, or rather the least national, in spirit,
                        and thus most easily adopted by another race; it was moreover, like that of
                        the Augustan Age, the literature of a courtly circle enjoying the favour and
                        contributing to the glory of a royal patron. The earliest imitators of this
                        poetry were Catullus and the other poets contemporary with him, such as
                        Calvus, Caecilius, Cinna, and Varro Atacinus, the author of the epic poem of
                        Jason. In the Augustan Age Gallus had not only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg42" id="Pg42" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>obtained distinction as the author of original elegics in
                        the style of the amatory poetry of Alexandria, but had translated a poem of
                        Euphorion of Chalcis<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>,
                        whom Cicero holds up as the type of effeminacy in literature in contrast
                        with the manliness of Ennius<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>.
                        Tibullus to a certain extent, but still more Propertius and Ovid, followed
                        in the same line. From the Alexandrine poets they derived the form and many
                        of the materials of their art. Virgil, while familiar with the whole range
                        of Greek poetry and pressing it all into his service, has used the
                        Alexandrians more freely than any other Greek writers, with the exception of
                        Homer. Horace is most independent of them; there are no direct traces of
                        their works in any of his writings. The Greek authors to whom he
                        acknowledges his debt are the early Lyrists and Iambic writers, the poets of
                        the New Comedy, the philosophic writers of the later schools which arose out
                        of the teaching of Socrates, and especially Aristippus. Yet even in him the
                        influence of the Alexandrine tone is apparent, especially in his treatment
                        of the subjects taken from the Greek mythology. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This poetry of Alexandria, or rather this poetry of the Greek race in its
                        latter days, was, to a much greater extent, the artificial product of
                        culture and knowledge than the manifestation of original feeling or
                        intellectual power. The very language in which it was written was
                        artificial, far removed, not only in phraseology but in dialectical forms,
                        from the language of common life. Poetry was pursued as the recreation of
                        scholars and men of science; its chief aim was to satisfy a dilettante
                        curiosity:— </p>

                        the Hellenic race, and at the same time indicative of the absence of any
                        great centre of national life such as Athens had been in former times. To
                        these are sometimes added the more interesting names of Theocritus of
                        Syracuse, and of the idyllic poets Moschus of Syracuse and Bion of Smyrna,
                        although they are more associated with the fresh woods and pastures of
                        Sicily and Southern Italy. The chief materials used by the Alexandrine
                        writers in their poetry were the tales and fancies of the old mythology and
                        the results of natural science; the modes of human feeling to which they
                        mainly gave expression were the passion of love and the sensibility to the
                        beauty of Nature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nothing attests more forcibly the original power and richness of faculty
                        which shaped the primitive fancies of the Greek mythology into legend,
                        poetry, and art, than the perennial vitality with which this mythology has
                        reappeared under many forms, satisfying many different wants of the human
                        mind, at various epochs, from the time of its birth even down to the present
                        day. In the contrasts often drawn between the classical and the romantic
                        imagination, it is sometimes forgotten that this Greek mythology was richer
                        in romantic personages, situations, and incidents, than the mythology or
                        early legends of any other race. In the nobler eras of Greek literature,
                        after the creative impulse ceased out of which the mythology and its natural
                        accompaniment epic poetry had arisen, the legends and personages of gods and
                        heroes supplied to the lyrical poets an ideal background by connexion with
                        which they glorified the passions and interests of their own time: to the
                        tragic poets of Athens they supplied beings of heroic stature, situations of
                        transcendent import, by means of which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg44" id="Pg44" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they
                        were enabled to give body and shape to the deepest thoughts on human
                        destiny. The Alexandrians, and those Greek writers who came long after them,
                        such as Quintus Calaber and Nonnus, did not seek to impart any recondite
                        meaning to the legends which they revived, but rather to divest them of any
                        sacred or ethical associations, and to present them to their readers simply
                        as bright and marvellous tales of passion and adventure. They endeavoured,
                        either in the form of continuous epics or in the more appropriate form of
                        ‘epyllia’ or epic idyls, to enable their readers to escape in fancy from the
                        dull uniformity of their own time into a world of action in the bright
                        morning of the national life. They sought especially to satisfy two impulses
                        of the Greek nature which still survived out of the more powerful energies
                        which had given birth to art and poetry,—the childlike curiosity (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Ἕλληνες ἀεὶ παῖδες</span></span>) which delights in hearing a story told, and the
                        artistic passion to make present to the eye or the fancy distinct pictures
                        and images of beauty and symmetry. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The later development of the Greek intellect was however more critical and
                        scientific than creative. Science, learning, and criticism were especially
                        encouraged and cultivated at Alexandria. The impulse given by Aristotle to
                        natural observation and enquiry, and the large intercourse with the East
                        which followed on the conquests of Alexander and the establishment of the
                        kingdoms of his successors, led to a great increase of knowledge, or, in the
                        absence of definite knowledge, of curiosity and speculation. The spirit of
                        enquiry no longer, as in the days of the older philosophers, endeavoured to
                        solve the whole problem of the universe, but to observe and systematise the
                        phenomena of the special sciences. Natural history, botany, and medicine
                        were studied zealously and successfully; the subjects of astronomy and
                        meteorology excited equal interest, though the want of the appliances
                        necessary for these studies made them more barren in results. A great
                        advance was made in the knowledge of remote places of the earth and of their
                        various products. The novelty of these enquiries, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg45" id="Pg45" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the knowledge resulting from them, stimulated curiosity
                        and the imaginative emotion which accompanies it; and the enthusiasm of
                        science combining with the enthusiasm of literary criticism gave birth to a
                        new kind of didactic poetry, which aimed at expounding the phenomena of
                        Nature in the epic diction of Homer. Among the best-known authors of this
                        didactic poetry are Aratus, Callimachus, and Nicander,—the last described
                        as being a poet, a grammarian, and a physician, a combination characteristic
                        of the spirit in which both science and literature were cultivated. These
                        writers supplied materials which Virgil used in the Georgics, and in the
                        special examination of that poem it will be seen that he adopted other
                        characteristics of the Alexandrine learning. The description by Ovid of the

                        models on which it was founded. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The poetry of Alexandria touched most on the realities of human life in its
                        treatment of the passion of love and the enjoyment of the beauty of Nature.
                        These are, in unadventurous times and in eras of advanced civilisation, the
                        main motives of the imaginative literature which seeks its interest in the
                        actual life of the present. Callimachus and Euphorion are mentioned as the
                        models followed by Gallus, Propertius, and Tibullus<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>. They, as well as their Roman
                        followers, seem largely to have illustrated their own feelings and
                        experience by recondite allusions to the innumerable heroines of ancient
                        mythology. The passion of Medea for Jason is the motive which gives its
                        chief human interest to the Argonautics of Apollonius, as the passion of
                        Dido for Aeneas, suggested by it, gives the chief purely human interest to
                        the Aeneid. But the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg46" id="Pg46" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>most powerful
                        delineation of this kind in any writer of that period, recalling in its
                        intensity the ‘burning passion set to the lyre by the Aeolian maiden,’ is
                        the monologue of Simaetha in the second Idyl of Theocritus, of which Virgil
                        has produced but a faint echo in his </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The love of Nature, though not then for the first time awakened,—for there
                        are clear indications of the powerful influence of this sentiment, though in
                        subordination to human interests, in the earlier epic, lyric, and dramatic
                        poetry,—came then prominently forward as an element of refined pleasure in
                        life, and as an inspiring influence both to poets and painters. The cause of
                        the growth of this sentiment has been sought<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> partly in the rise of great cities, such
                        as Antioch, Seleucia, Alexandria, which by debarring men from that free
                        familiar contact with the forms, movement, and life of Nature enjoyed by the
                        older Greeks, created an imaginative longing for a return to this communion
                        as to a lost paradise. The longing to escape from the heat and confinement
                        of a great southern city to the fresh sights and free air of woods and
                        mountains must have been often felt by poets and artists who had exchanged
                        their homes on the shores and the islands of the Aegean for the dusty
                        streets of Alexandria. Probably the Metamorphoses of Ovid convey as good an
                        idea as anything in Latin literature of the various influences active in the
                        Alexandrine poetry; and the kind of scene which he takes most delight in
                        painting in that poem is that of a cool and clear stream hidden in the thick
                        shade of woods and haunted by the Nymphs. The taste for gardens within great
                        cities, first developed at this time and afterwards carried to an extreme
                        pitch of luxury in the early Roman Empire<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>, further illustrates <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg47" id="Pg47" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the need
                        felt for this kind of refreshment from objects of natural beauty. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Other causes have been suggested for the growth of this sentiment, as, for
                        instance, the decay of the polytheistic fancies, which, by regarding each
                        natural object as identified with some spiritual being, made it less an
                        object of affection and curiosity for its own sake. The sudden growth of
                        this sentiment in ancient times in an age of great luxury and culture is
                        analogous to the great development and expansion of the feeling under
                        similar circumstances in the latter part of the eighteenth century. In both
                        cases the sentiment arose from the desire to escape from the tedium of an
                        artificial life. The love of Nature is not, as we might naturally expect it
                        to be, a feeling much experienced by those who live in constant contact and
                        conflict with its sterner forces, as by husbandmen, herdsmen, and hunters;
                        nor is it developed consciously in primitive times or among unsophisticated
                        races. It is the accompaniment of leisure, culture, and refinement of life.
                        Some races are more susceptible of this feeling than others; and perhaps the
                        Greek with his lively social temper, and the tendency of his imagination to
                        reduce all beautiful objects to a human shape, was less capable of the
                        disinterested delight in the sights and sounds of the outward world than the
                        Italian. It was apparently among Siculians, the kindred of the people of
                        Latium, and not among men living in the mountains of Arcadia or Thessaly,
                        that Theocritus found the personages of his rustic idyl. Whether it was from
                        the greater susceptibility of their national temperament, or from the fact
                        that they lived in the later times of the world, to which the sentiment was
                        more congenial, the Roman poets of the Augustan Age and of that immediately
                        preceding it are the truest exponents of the love of Nature in ancient
                        times; though it may be that, without the originating impulse given by the
                        Greek mind in the Alexandrian period, and perpetuated by educated Greeks
                        living in Southern Italy, this love of natural beauty might never have been
                        consciously realised by them as a source of poetic inspiration. </p>
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span>
                    <a name="Pg48" id="Pg48" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The pursuit of literature in the Alexandrian Age was accompanied with great
                        activity in the other arts, especially in sculpture and painting. These last
                        continued to be carried on by Greeks in Italy after Rome had succeeded to
                        Alexandria as the centre of human culture. Sculpture and carving on wood,
                        works of art in bronze, and the graving on gems continued to perpetuate an
                        aesthetic half-belief in the Olympian deities and in the other creations of
                        the Greek theology. Painting seems to have treated the same kind of subjects
                        and to have aimed at satisfying the same class of feelings as the poetry of
                        the Alexandrian time. Many of its subjects it seems to have drawn directly
                        from the works of poets<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>. The paintings
                        recovered from Pompeii, which may be presumed to have continued the
                        traditions of a somewhat earlier art, illustrate the same tastes which were
                        gratified by the poetical treatment of mythological subjects, of landscape,
                        and of the passion of love. The knowledge acquired by science seems also to
                        have been pressed into this service by the artist. The frequent
                        representations of wild animals originated in the same kind of interest
                        which animated Nicander to the composition of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Θηριακά</span></span><a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>. Realistic reproductions from common life seem also to have
                        been frequently executed by ancient, as by modern, painters. If, as is not
                        improbable, the ‘Moretum’ and the ‘Copa’ are translations or imitations of
                        Greek originals, they exemplify still further the close connexion between
                        the art of the poet and of the painter among the Alexandrian dilettanti. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The various kinds of art which bring human forms and scenes from outward
                        nature before the eye, and especially the art of the painter, must
                        accordingly be taken into account as means of making the creations of Greek
                        fancy and the objects of Greek sentiment vividly present to the Roman
                        imagination. They not only acted immediately on the mind of the poet by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg49" id="Pg49" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>suggesting to him directly subjects for his
                        art and supplying frequent illustrations for the treatment of native
                        subjects, but they helped to interpret to cultivated minds his allusions to
                        or reproductions from the poets of former times. The whole learning, fancy,
                        and sentiment of the Alexandrians seem to have been absorbed and made their
                        own by the Augustan poets. Virgil and Horace, indeed, formed their ideal of
                        art from the works of a greater time. Their studies of Greek familiarised
                        their minds with what was most perfect in form, noblest in thought, feeling,
                        and expression in the older poets. Yet in so far as Roman poetry is a
                        reproduction of Greek poetry, it is the mind of the Alexandrian rather than
                        of the old Ionian, Aeolian, or Athenian Greek that lives again in the
                        Augustan literature. Probably this has been in favour of the Roman writers.
                        With their highly susceptible and cultivated appreciation of excellence,
                        their originality might have been altogether overpowered by an exclusive
                        study of the nobler and severer models. In receiving the instruction of
                        contemporary Greeks, based to a great extent on the Alexandrine learning,
                        and in reproducing the materials, manner, and diction of Alexandrine poets,
                        they must have become conscious of the greater freshness and vigour of their
                        own genius, of the more vital force of their own language, of their grander
                        national life, of the privilege of being Romans, and of the blessing of
                        breathing Italian air. Whatever was most worthy to survive in the spirit
                        which animated the refined industry of the Alexandrian Age has been
                        preserved in greater beauty and vitality in Virgil, Propertius, and Ovid,
                        combined with the ideas, feelings, passions, and experience of a new and
                        more vigorous race. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> One other circumstance has yet to be taken into account as affecting the
                        culture and taste of the age, viz. the number of poets who lived at the time
                        and the relations which subsisted between them. Those whose works have been
                        preserved are only a few out of a larger circle who worked each in his own
                        province of art, and listened to and criticised the works of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg50" id="Pg50" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>friends. Of the poets belonging to this
                        circle whose works have not reached us, Varius, the older contemporary and
                        life-long friend of Virgil, first acquired distinction as a writer of that
                        kind of epic peculiar to Rome which treated of contemporary subjects and was
                        dedicated to the personal glory of some great man. This kind of poem had
                        probably originated with the ‘Scipio’ of Ennius, but it had been especially
                        cultivated in the age of Cicero. Varius performed the office from which
                        Virgil and Horace shrank, that, namely, of telling in verse the contemporary
                        history of his own time, glorifying in one poem the memory of Julius Caesar,
                        in another celebrating the wars of Augustus. Afterwards he resigned to
                        Virgil the honours of epic poetry, and entered into rivalry with Pollio as
                        the author of tragedy. His drama of Thyestes was represented at the Games
                        celebrated after the battle of Actium, and for this drama he is said to have
                        received a million sesterces<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>. This play is praised both
                        by Quintilian and Tacitus in the dialogue De Oratoribus. Quintilian says of
                        it, ‘it may be compared with any work of the Greeks:’ but the drama is the
                        branch of literature in which the judgment of a Latin critic is of least
                        value. The Thyestes, like the Medea of Ovid, was probably a play of that
                        rhetorical kind which was cultivated under the Empire, and which never got
                        possession of the stage as the older tragedies of Attius and Pacuvius did.
                        Cornelius Gallus has been already mentioned among the men of public eminence
                        who cultivated poetry. He was a follower of the Alexandrians, and is
                        mentioned by Propertius and Ovid as their own precursor in elegiac poetry.
                        Aemilius Macer, a native of Verona, nearly of the same age as Virgil, and
                        supposed to be shadowed forth as the Mopsus of the fifth Eclogue, was the
                        author of a didactic poem called Ornithogonia, written in imitation of the
                        Alexandrine Nicander. Valgius Rufus and Aristius Fuscus, mentioned by Horace
                        as among the friendly critics by whom he wished his Satires to be approved,
                        and to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg51" id="Pg51" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whom he addresses some of his Odes
                        and Epistles, are also known as authors. In his later life Horace maintained
                        friendly relations and correspondence with the younger men, such as Iulus
                        Antonius, Florus, etc., who united a taste for poetry with the pursuits of
                        young men of rank. And among the pleasures which Ovid recalls in the dreary
                        days of his exile, none seem to have been more prized by him than the
                        familiar relations in which he had lived with the older poets and with those
                        of his own standing<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>. The
                        Alexandrine influence is visible in the kinds of poetry chiefly cultivated
                        by these writers, especially in the didactic poem, the artificial epic, and
                        the erotic elegy. We hear also of epic or narrative poems on contemporary
                        subjects, of one or two dramatic writers, and also of writers in verse on
                        grammatical and rhetorical subjects<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There is no feature in the social life of the Augustan Age so pleasant to
                        contemplate as the brotherly friendship, free apparently from the jealousies
                        of individuals and the petty passions of literary coteries, in which the
                        most eminent poets and men of letters lived with one another. The only
                        exception to the general state of good feeling of which there is any
                        indication is an apparent coolness between Horace and Propertius. The latter
                        poet neither mentions nor alludes to his illustrious contemporary, though
                        both were friends of Maecenas and of Virgil; and Horace, though he does not
                        mention Propertius by name, as he does Tibullus and most of the other
                        distinguished poets of the time, probably alludes to him in a passage which
                        was not intended to be complimentary<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a>. But in
                        general what Plato says of the souls engaged in the pursuit and
                        contemplation of intellectual beauty—‘Envy stands aloof from the divine
                        company’—was true of the ‘divine company’ of poets <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg52" id="Pg52" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the Age of Augustus. And the sincere and appreciative
                        interest which they took in one another was not only a source of great
                        happiness in their lives, but was able to fulfil the function of an
                        enlightened and generous criticism. Poets were in the habit of reading their
                        works to their friends before submitting them to the public. It is
                        characteristic of the modesty of Virgil and of his unceasing aim at
                        perfection that he was in the habit of reading to his friends chiefly those
                        passages in his works of which he was himself distrustful. The fastidious
                        taste of Horace sometimes rebelled against the importunity of those who
                        desired to hear him read his own compositions. Yet the well-known 
                        <a name="corr052" id="corr052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">testimony of</span> Ovid proves that he was not averse
                        to gratify an appreciative listener:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The appreciation and criticism of cultivated friends, themselves authors as
                        well as critics, must have stimulated and corrected the taste of the poets
                        of the age. The genius which is most purely original in its activity, and
                        which communicates an altogether novel impulse to the world, relies
                        absolutely on itself, and may be little stimulated by sympathy or affected
                        by criticism. Of such a type Lucretius in ancient and Wordsworth in modern
                        times are probably the best examples, though Dante and Milton seem to
                        approach nearer to it than to the type of those whose genius is equally
                        great in receiving from, as in giving to, the world—the type of genius of
                        Homer, Sophocles, Shakspeare, and Goethe. The great qualities of writers of
                        the first type are force, independence, boldness of invention and
                        speculation, absolute sincerity. They are at the same time liable to the
                        defects of incompleteness, one-sidedness, disregard of the true proportion
                        of things. Their works do not produce the impression of that all-pervading,
                        perfectly-balanced sanity of genius, which the Greeks meant when they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg53" id="Pg53" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>applied the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">σοφοί</span></span> to their
                        poets, and which makes the great men of the second type not only powerful
                        movers but also the wisest teachers of the world. The best poetry of the
                        Augustan Age, if wanting in the highest mode of creative energy, is
                        eminently free from the defects which sometimes result from the intenser
                        form of imagination; it is in a remarkable degree pervaded and controlled by
                        this sanity of genius. This excellence of the Augustan literature may be
                        partly, as was said before, attributed to the familiar intercourse which men
                        of letters enjoyed with men of action and large social influence; partly,
                        and probably to a greater degree, to the cultivated and generous criticism
                        which men of genius and fine accomplishment imparted to and received from
                        one another. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Outside of this friendly circle of men eminent in letters and social
                        position there were other literary and critical coteries hostile to them,
                        who seem to have chosen the merits of the old writers as the battle-ground
                        on which they engaged the new school of poetry and criticism. These critical
                        coteries Horace treats, as Catullus treats his ‘vile poets, pests of the
                        age,’ and as Pope treated Dennis and the other poetasters of his time. He
                        was evidently sensitive to the envy excited by his genius and by the favour
                        of Maecenas, and in his later years it afforded him pleasure to be less
                        exposed than he had been to carping criticism:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The almost exclusive devotion to poetry on the part of the meanest as well
                        as the greatest writers of the Augustan Age seems to demand some
                        explanation. The natural genius of Rome was more adapted to oratory,
                        history, and didactic exposition than to any of the great forms of poetry.
                        In the previous generation prose literature had reached the highest degree
                        of perfection. The style of Cicero is one of the most admirable and
                        effective vehicles for the varied purposes of passionate invective or
                        persuasive oratory, of familiar correspondence, and of popularising the
                        results of ethical, political, and religious reflection. In Caesar and
                        Sallust the record of great events in the national life had at last found a
                        power of clear, terse, and chastened diction, superior as a vehicle of
                        simple narrative to the style of the two great historians of later times, if
                        not so rich and varied in colouring and in poetical and reflective
                        suggestion. Of the prose literature of the Augustan Age we possess only one
                        great monument, the extant parts of ‘the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg55" id="Pg55" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>colossal master-work of Livy;’ and that was the product of the later and
                        least brilliant period of this epoch. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The cause of the sudden and permanent decline of Roman oratory was the
                        extinction of political life. Public speech could no longer be, as it had
                        been for nearly two centuries, a great power in the commonwealth. Under the
                        vigilant and judicious administration of Augustus there was not scope even
                        for that kind of oratory which flourished under his successors, and became a
                        very formidable weapon in the hands of the ‘delatores,’—that, namely, which
                        is employed in the prosecution and defence of men charged with grave
                        offences against the State. Neither was there scope or inclination for
                        philosophical or historical composition. Such freedom of enquiry as Cicero
                        allowed himself in his treatises De Legibus and De Republica would scarcely
                        have been tolerated under the monarchy; and the world was in no mood for any
                        severe strain of thought or any questioning of the first principles of
                        things. The new era desired ease, an escape from care and the perplexities
                        of thought, as well as peace and material well-being. The spirit of the age
                        was announced in the pastoral strain, which celebrated its commencement in
                        the apotheosis of Julius Caesar, ‘amat bonus otia Daphnis.’ Nor would it
                        have been possible for any one to have composed or at least to have
                        published a candid history of the times; and it may have been the discovery
                        of this impossibility that induced Asinius Pollio to leave his work
                        unfinished. It would indeed have been a gain for all time had a Roman
                        Thucydides recorded the ‘movement in the State’ from the Consulship of
                        Metellus till the battle of Actium with the accuracy and impartiality, the
                        graphic condensation, the sober dignity, the sensitive perception of the

                        philosophical discernment of great political principles destined to act in
                        the same way ‘so long as the nature of man remains the same,’ and the deep
                        tragic pathos which make, even at the present day, the record of ‘the
                        twenty-seven years’ war of the Peloponnesians and Athenians’ the most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg56" id="Pg56" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>vividly interesting and permanently
                        instructive historical work which the world possesses. But even had the
                        genius of Rome been capable of producing a Thucydides, the circumstances of
                        the time would have reduced him to silence. Tacitus regards the
                        establishment of the Empire as equally fatal to the genius of the historian,
                        as it was to the genius of the orator:—‘Postquam bellatum apud Actium atque
                        omnem potentiam ad unum conferri pacis interfuit, magna illa ingenia
                        cessere. Simul veritas pluribus modis infracta, primum inscitia rei publicae
                        ut alienae, mox libidine assentandi<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the other hand, many circumstances contributed to give a great stimulus
                        to poetical literature in its most trivial and transitory as well as its
                        noblest and most enduring manifestations. It is remarked by a recent French
                            writer<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>, that poetry is the last form
                        of literature to wither under a despotism. But it suffers from it most
                        irretrievably in the end. The poetic imagination is able to deceive itself
                        by turning away from what is painful and repulsive in the world, and by
                        appearing to extract the element of good, of vivid life, or impressive
                        grandeur out of things evil and fatal in their ultimate effects. Thus it is
                        able to glorify the pomp and state of imperialism, just as it is able to
                        glorify the charm to the senses or the attraction to the social nature
                        afforded by the life of passion and pleasure. But, in the long run, the
                        decay in the higher energies arising either from the loss of liberty or the
                        loss of self-control is more fatal to the nobler forms of art and poetry
                        than to any other products of intelligence. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again, the mechanical difficulties of the art had been to a great extent
                        overcome, in the previous age. The discovery of the new and rich ore of the
                        Latin language, revealed and wrought into shapes of massive beauty and
                        delicate grace by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg57" id="Pg57" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lucretius and Catullus,
                        awakened and kept alive in the great writers of this age the desire to
                        perfect the work commenced by their predecessors, and to develope all the
                        majesty, beauty, and harmony of which their native speech was capable. The
                        education in grammar, rhetoric, and Greek literature, which in the later
                        years of the Republic had trained men for the contests of public life,
                        prepared them to recognise and appreciate the perfection of style and of
                        rhythm which was now for the first time attained. But the attainment of this
                        perfection was a stumbling block to writers of an inferior order, and to all
                        the poets who came afterwards. The Augustan poets left to their successors,
                        what they had not themselves received, the fatal legacy of an established
                        poetical diction. The resources of the language for the highest purposes of
                        poetry seem to have been exhausted by the supreme effort of this epoch. The
                        golden perfection of the Augustan style gave place to the forced rhetoric
                        and the sensational extravagance of the Neronian age and to the soberer but
                        tamer imitations of the Flavian era. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In its inner inspiration, as well as its outward expression, the Augustan
                        poetry was the maturest development of the national mind. The inspiring
                        influences of Latin poetry were the idea of Rome, the appreciation of Greek
                        art, the genial Italian life. We have seen how the first establishment of
                        the Empire gave to the national idea a temporary importance and prominence
                        which it had not had since Ennius first awoke his countrymen to the
                        consciousness of their destiny. It was only in the Augustan Age, or during
                        the few years preceding it, that the taste of the Romans was sufficiently
                        educated to appreciate the perfect art of the Greeks. The whole of Italy was
                        now for the first time united in one nation. A new generation had been born
                        and grown to manhood since the Social War. The pride in Rome and the love of
                        the whole land might now be felt by all men born between the Alps and the
                        Straits of Sicily. The districts far removed from the capital, ‘by the
                        sounding Aufidus’ or ‘the slow-winding Mincius,’ still kept <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg58" id="Pg58" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>alive the traditions of a severer morality and the
                        habits of a simpler and happier life<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>. They were still able to nourish the
                        susceptible mind of childhood with poetic fancies<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>. In the
                        following generation the idea of the empire was one no longer of inspiring
                        novelty, but rather of a dull oppression. The taste for Greek literature had
                        lost its freshness and quickening power. The natural enjoyment of life, the
                        susceptibility to beauty in art and nature, the love of simplicity, were no
                        longer possible to minds enervated and hearts deadened by the unrelieved
                        monotony of luxurious living. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil is the earliest in time and much the most important in rank among the
                    extant poets of the Augustan Age. It is only in comparatively recent times that
                    any question has arisen as to the high position due to him among the great poets
                    of all ages. His pre-eminence not only above all those of his own country, but
                    above all other poets with the exception of Homer, was unquestioned in the
                    ancient Roman world. His countrymen claimed for him a rank on a level with,
                    sometimes even above, that of the great father of European literature. And this
                    estimate of his genius became traditional, and was confirmed by the general
                    voice of modern criticism. For eighteen centuries, wherever any germ of literary
                    taste survived in Europe, his poems were the principal medium through which the
                    heroic age of Greece as well as the ancient life of Rome and Italy was
                    apprehended. No writer has, on the whole, entered so largely and profoundly into
                    the education of three out of the four chief representatives of European
                    culture—the Italians, the French, and the English—at various stages of their
                    intellectual development. The history of the progress of taste might be largely
                    illustrated by reference to the place which the works of Virgil have held, in
                    the teaching of youth and among the refined pleasures of manhood, between the
                    age of Dante and the early part of the present century. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Since that time, however, an undoubted reaction has set in against the prestige
                    once enjoyed by Latin poetry. And from this reaction Virgil has been the chief
                    sufferer. The peculiar <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg60" id="Pg60" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gifts, social and
                    intellectual, of Horace have continued to secure for him many friends in every
                    country and in every generation. The spirit of Lucretius is perhaps more in
                    unison with the spirit of the present than with that of any previous age, owing
                    to changes both in imaginative feeling and in speculative curiosity and belief
                    through which the world is now passing. The sincerity and unstudied grace of
                    Catullus are immediately recognised by all who read his works. But in regard to
                    Virgil, if former centuries assigned him too high a place, the criticism of the
                    present century, in Germany at least, and for a certain time in England, has
                    been much less favourable. French criticism has indeed remained undeviatingly
                    loyal, and regards him as the poet, not of Rome only, but of all those nations
                    which are the direct inheritors of the Latin civilisation<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>. And in England, at the present time, the
                    estimate of his genius, expressed both by writers of acknowledged reputation and
                    in the current criticism of the day, is much more favourable than it was some
                    thirty years ago. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It would be neither desirable nor possible to enter on a critical examination of
                    the value of a writer, who has been so much admired through so long a time,
                    without taking some account of the prestige attaching to his name. It may be of
                    use therefore to bring together some of the more familiar evidences of his
                    reputation and influence in former times, to show the existence of a temporary
                    reaction of opinion and to assign causes for it, and to indicate the grounds on
                    which his pre-eminence as the culminating point in Latin literature and his high
                    position among the poets of the world appear to rest. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was as a great epic poet, the poet of national glory and heroic action,
                        that he was most esteemed in former times. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg61" id="Pg61" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The Aeneid may not have been regarded as more perfect in execution than
                        the Eclogues and Georgics, but it was regarded as a work of higher
                        inspiration. The criticism which Virgil by implication applies to his
                        earlier works, in the use of such expressions as ‘ludere quae vellem,’
                        ‘carmina qui lusi pastorum,’ ‘in tenui labor<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>,’ etc., as compared with the high
                        ambition with which he first indicates his purpose of composing an epic poem
                        in celebration of the glory of Augustus— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> coincides with the view which the ancients took of the relative value of the
                        poetry of external nature and of heroic action. The contemporaries and
                        successors of Virgil did not share in the sense of some failure in the
                        treatment of his subject which is attributed to Virgil himself; and hence
                        they ranked him as the equal of Homer in the largest and most important
                        province of poetry. And as this comparison was the source of excessive
                        honour in the past, it has been the cause of the depreciation to which he
                        has been exposed in the present century. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The great reputation enjoyed by the Aeneid dates from the first appearance
                        of the poem. The earliest indication of the admiration which it was destined
                        to excite appears in the tones of expectation and enthusiasm with which
                        Propertius predicts the appearance of a work greater than the Iliad:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The immediate effect produced by the poem may be traced in the frequent
                        allusions to the story of Aeneas in the fourth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg62" id="Pg62" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>book of the Odes of Horace. The continuance of this
                        influence is unmistakeable in Ovid, and there are also many traces of
                        Virgilian expression in the prose style of Livy<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>. The
                        author of the dialogue ‘De Oratoribus’ testifies to the favour which the
                        poet enjoyed, even before the publication of his epic, both with the Emperor
                        and with the whole people, who ‘on hearing some of his verses recited in the
                        theatre rose in a body and greeted him, as he happened to be present at the
                        spectacle, with the same marks of respect which they showed to the Emperor
                            himself<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>.’ He
                        would thus appear, even in his lifetime, to have thoroughly ‘touched the
                        national fibre<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a>,’ and to have gained
                        that place in the admiration of his countrymen which he never afterwards
                        lost. By the poets who came after him his memory was cherished with the
                        veneration men feel for a great master, united to the affection which they
                        feel for a departed friend. Lucan indeed rather enters into rivalry with him
                        than follows in his footsteps; nor can there be any surer way of learning to
                        appreciate the peculiar greatness of Virgil’s manner than by reading
                        passages of the Aeneid alongside of passages of the Pharsalia. The new poets
                        under the Flavian dynasty, Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, and Statius,
                        though they failed to apprehend the secret of its success, made the Aeneid
                        their model, in the arrangement of their materials, in their diction, and in
                        the structure of their verse. Statius, in bidding farewell to his Thebaid,
                        uses these words of acknowledgement:— </p>

                        over his poems, says of Virgil that he could have surpassed Horace in lyric,
                        Varius in tragic poetry, had he chosen to enter into rivalry with them<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>.

                        possessed by Silius, adds these words: ‘of Virgil principally whose birthday
                        he kept with more solemnity than his own, especially at Naples, where he
                        used to visit his monument as if it were a temple.’ But the greatest proof
                        of Virgil’s influence on the later literature of Rome is seen in many traces
                        of imitation of his style in the language of the historian Tacitus, the one
                        great literary genius born under the Empire. So great a master of expression
                        would not have incurred this debt except to one whom he regarded as entitled
                        above all others to stamp the speech of Rome with an imperial impress. In
                        Juvenal there are many references and allusions to familiar passages in the
                            Aeneid<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>: and it appears from him that the
                        works of Virgil and Horace had in his time become what they have since
                        continued to be, the common school-books of all who obtained a liberal
                        education. It is one of the hardships of the schoolmaster’s life, described
                        in his seventh Satire, to have to listen by lamplight to the ‘crambe

                        commentaries written on his works, the most famous of them being the still
                        extant commentary of Servius, belonging to the latter part of the fourth
                        century. The fortune of Virgil has in this respect been similar to that of
                        his great countryman Dante. From the time of his death till the extinction
                        of ancient classical culture, there was a regular succession of rhetoricians
                        and grammarians who lectured and wrote treatises on his various poems. Among
                        those who preceded Servius, the most famous names are those of Asconius
                        Pedianus, Annaeus Cornutus, the friend of Persius, and Valerius Probus, in
                        the first century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> These commentators supplied
                        materials to Suetonius for the life on which that of Aelius Donatus, which
                        is still extant, is founded. The frequent quotations from Virgil in the
                        desultory criticism of Aulus Gellius and the systematic discussions in the
                        Saturnalia of Macrobius attest the minute study of his poems in the interval
                        between the second and the fifth centuries. Similar testimony to his
                        continued influence is afforded by the early Christian writers, especially
                        by Augustine. And though there may be traced in them a struggle between the
                        pleasure which they derived from his poetry and the alienation of their
                        sympathies owing to his paganism, yet it is probable that the favour shown
                        to him and to Cicero during the first strong reaction from everything
                        associated with the beauty of the older religion, was due as much to the
                        pure and humane spirit of their teaching as to the fascination of their
                        style: nor perhaps was this teaching inoperative in moulding the thought and
                        giving form to the religious imagination of the Latin Church. The number and
                        excellence of the MSS. of Virgil, the most famous of which date from the
                        fourth and fifth centuries, confirm the impression of the continued favour
                        which his works enjoyed before and subsequently to the overthrow of the
                        Roman rule in the West. Wherever learning flourished during the darkest
                        period of this later time, the poems of Virgil were held in special esteem.
                        Thus we read in connexion with the literary studies of Bede: ‘Virgil cast
                        over him the same spell <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg65" id="Pg65" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which he cast over
                        Dante: verses from the Aeneid break his narratives of martyrdoms, and the
                        disciple ventures on the track of the great master in a little eclogue
                        descriptive of the approach of spring<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>.’ His works were taught in the Church
                        schools: and the feeling with which he was regarded by the more tolerant
                        minds of the mediaeval Church appears in a mass sung in honour of St. Paul
                        at the end of the fifteenth century:— </p>

                        ignorant to know anything of his works, survived during the middle ages in
                        the fancies which ascribed to him the powers of a magician or beneficent
                        genius, appearing in many forms and at various times and places widely
                        separated from one another. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With the first revival of learning and letters in different countries, the
                        old pre-eminence of Virgil again asserts itself. In England ‘the earliest
                        classical revival’ (to quote again the words of Mr. Green) ‘restored Cicero
                        and Virgil to the list of monastic studies, and left its stamp on the
                        pedantic style, the profuse classical quotations of writers like William of
                        Malmesbury or John of Salisbury.’ One of the earliest works in Scottish
                        literature is the translation of the Aeneid by Gawain Douglas. It is
                        characteristic of the rudimentary state of learning at the time when this
                        translation appeared that the Sibyl is represented as a nun, who directs
                        Aeneas to tell his beads<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>. But the greatest
                        testimony to the persistence of Virgil’s fame and influence in the western
                        world is the homage which the genius of Dante pays to the shade of his great
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg66" id="Pg66" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>countryman. ‘May the long zeal avail me
                        and the great love that made me search thy volume. Thou art my master and my
                        author. Thou art he from whom I took the good style that did me honour<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a>.’ The feeling
                        with which Dante gives himself up to the guidance of Virgil through all the
                        mystery of the lower realms is like that under which Ennius evokes the shade
                        of Homer from the ‘halls of Acheron’ to interpret to him the secrets of
                        creation. Dante combines the reverence for a great master, which seems to be
                        more natural to the genius of Italy than to that of other nations, with a
                        high self-confidence and a bold and original invention. Lucretius expresses
                        a similar enthusiasm for Homer, Ennius, Empedocles, and Epicurus; and by
                        Virgil the same feeling is, though not directly expressed, yet profoundly
                        felt towards Homer and Lucretius. And in all these cases the admiration of
                        their predecessors is an incentive, not to imitative reproduction, but to
                        new creation. It was as the poet of ‘that Italy for which Camilla the
                        virgin, Euryalus, and Turnus and Nisus died of wounds’ that the poet of
                        mediaeval Florence paid homage to the ancient poet of Mantua. The admiration
                        of Dante, like that of Tacitus, is the more corroborative of the spell
                        exercised over the Italian mind by the art and style of Virgil from the
                        difference in the type of genius and character which these poets severally
                        represent. The influence of Virgil was exercised, with a power more
                        over-mastering and injurious to their originality, upon the later poets and
                        scholars of Italy with whom the Renaissance begins. The progress of modern
                        poetry was for a long time accompanied—and it would be difficult to say
                        whether it was thereby more obstructed or advanced—by a new undergrowth of
                        Latin poetry, for the higher forms of which Virgil served as the principal
                        model. Petrarch attached more importance to his epic poem of ‘Africa,’
                        written in imitation of the rhythm and style of the Aeneid, than to his
                        Sonnets. The influence of Virgil on the later Renaissance in Italy is
                        abundantly proved in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg67" id="Pg67" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the works of poets,
                        scholars, and men of letters in that age. Ninety editions of his works are
                        said to have been published before the year 1500<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>. From Italy this influence passed to France and England,
                        and was felt, not by scholars and critics only, but by the great poets and
                        essayists, the orators and statesmen of the seventeenth and eighteenth
                        centuries. It was discussed as an open question whether the Iliad or the
                        Aeneid was the greater epic poem: and it was then necessary for the admirers
                        of the Greek rather than of the Latin poet to assume an apologetic tone<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a>.
                        Scaliger ranked Virgil above Homer and Theocritus. His prestige was greatest
                        during the century of French ascendency in modern literature, that, namely,
                        between the age of Milton and that of Lessing. The chief critical law-giver
                        in that century was Voltaire, and no great critic has ever expressed a
                        livelier admiration of any poem than he has of the Aeneid. It is to him we
                        owe the saying, ‘Homère a fait Virgile, dit-on; si cela est, c’est sans
                        doute son plus bel ouvrage<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>.’ He claims elsewhere for the second, fourth, and sixth
                        books of the Aeneid a great superiority over the works of all Greek
                            poets<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>. He says also
                        that the Aeneid is the finest monument remaining from antiquity. As Spenser
                        was called the ‘poet’s poet,’ so Virgil might be called the orator’s poet.
                        Even by a rhetorician of the second century the question was discussed
                        whether Virgil ‘was more a poet or an orator<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>.’ Bossuet is said to have known his works by
                            heart<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>. In
                        the great era of English oratory, no author seems to have been so familiarly
                        known or was so often quoted. We read in a recent sketch of the life of
                            Burke<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>, ‘Most writers have constantly beside them some favourite
                        classical author, from whom they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg68" id="Pg68" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>endeavour
                        to take their prevailing tone.... Burke, according to Butler, always had a
                        ragged Delphin Virgil not far from his elbow.’ A vestige of the attraction
                        which his words had for an older school of English politicians may be traced
                        in the survival of Virgilian quotation in some of the parliamentary warfare
                        of recent times. The important place which Virgil has filled in the teaching
                        of our public schools—the great nurses of our classic statesmen—has
                        perhaps not been without some influence in shaping our national history<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>. It would be no
                        exaggeration to say that the poems of Virgil, and especially the Aeneid,
                        have contributed more than any other works of art in modern times, not only
                        to stamp the impression of ancient Rome on the imagination, but to educate
                        the sensibility to generous emotion as well as to literary beauty. There is
                        probably no author, even at the present day, of whom some knowledge may be
                        with more certainty assumed among cultivated people of every nation. </p>

                        any one ever succeeded in securing that which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg69" id="Pg69" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Tacitus says ‘should be to a man the one object of an
                        insatiable ambition,’ to leave after him ‘a happy memory of himself<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a>,’ that may be truly said of
                        Virgil. Though his name may henceforth be less famous, it cannot be deprived
                        of its lustre in the past. Nor does it seem possible that this reputation
                        could have been maintained so long, in different ages and nations, without
                        some catholic excellence, depending on original gifts as well as trained
                        accomplishment, which could unite so many diversely-constituted minds of the
                        highest capacity in a common sentiment of veneration. The secret of his long
                        ascendency is, in the words of Sainte-Beuve, that ‘he gave a new direction
                        to taste, to the passions, to sensibility: he divined at a critical period
                        of the world’s history what the future would love.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is only in the present century that the question has been asked whether
                        this great reputation was deserved. But the earliest witness who might be
                        called against his claims to this high distinction is Virgil himself. In the
                        Eclogues and Georgics the delight which he finds in the exercise of his art
                        is qualified by a sense of humility, arising from a feeling of some want of
                        elevation in his subject. In his last hours he desired that the Aeneid
                        should be burned: and that this was not a mere impulse arising from the
                        depression of illness may be inferred from the request which he made to
                        Varius, before leaving Italy, ‘that if anything happened to him he should
                        destroy the Aeneid.’ A letter written to Augustus is quoted by Macrobius, in
                        which Virgil speaks of himself as having undertaken a work of such vast
                        compass ‘almost from a perversion of mind<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>.’ No poet could well be animated by a loftier ambition than
                        Virgil; yet few great poets seem to have been so little satisfied with their
                        own success. It was not in his nature to feel or express the confident sense
                        of superiority which sustained Ennius and Lucretius in their self-appointed
                        tasks, nor even that satisfaction with the work he had done and that
                        assurance of an abiding place in the memory of men which relieve the
                        ironical self-disparagement of Horace. </p>
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span>
                    <a name="Pg70" id="Pg70" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The most obvious explanation of this passionate and pathetic desire that the
                        work to which he had given eleven years of his maturest power should not
                        survive him, is the unfinished state, in respect of style, in which the poem
                        was left. He had set aside three years for the final revision of the work
                        and the removal of those temporary ‘make-shifts,’ which had been originally
                        inserted with full knowledge of their inadequacy, in order not to check the
                        ardour of composition. After having devoted three years of his youth to the
                        execution of a work so slight in purpose and so small in compass as the
                        Eclogues, he might well feel depressed by the thought that a work of such
                        high purpose and so vast a scope as the Aeneid—and a work of which such
                        expectations as those expressed by Propertius were entertained—should be
                        given to the world before receiving the final touch of the master’s hand. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet the words in the letter to Augustus,—‘that I fancy myself to have been
                        almost under the influence of some fatuity in engaging on so great a
                        work’—if they are to be taken as a true expression of his feeling, imply a
                        deeper ground of dissatisfaction with his undertaking. Horace, in the
                        estimate which he forms of his own work, seems to maintain the due balance
                        between the self-assertion and the modesty of genius. But his modesty arises
                        from his thorough self-knowledge, and from his understanding the limits
                        within which a complete success was attainable by him. That of Virgil seems
                        to be a weakness incidental to his greatest gifts, his sense of perfection,
                        his appreciation of every kind of excellence. His large appreciation of the
                        genius of others, from the oldest Greek to the latest Latin poet, his regard
                        for the authority of the past, his attitude of a scholar in many schools,
                        his willing acceptance of Homer as his guide through all the unfamiliar
                        region of heroic adventure, were scarcely compatible with the buoyant
                        spirit, as of some discoverer of unknown lands, which was needed to support
                        him in an enterprise so arduous and so long-sustained as the composition of
                        a great literary epic. The task which he set himself required of him to
                        combine into one harmonious work of art, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg71" id="Pg71" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which at the same time should bear the stamp of originality,—of being a
                        new thing in the world,—the characteristics and excellences of various
                        minds belonging to various times. With such aims it was scarcely possible
                        that the actual execution of his work should not fall below his ideal of
                        perfection. Especially must he have recognised his own deficiency in the
                        pure epic impulse, which apparently sustained Homer without conscious
                        effort. He could not feel or make others feel the culminating interest in
                        the combat between Turnus and Aeneas, which Homer feels and makes others
                        feel in the combat between Hector and Achilles. In his earlier national poem
                        he had vindicated the glory of the ploughshare in opposition to the glory of
                        the sword; and, in his later battle-pieces, he must have felt his
                        immeasurable inferiority to the poet of the Iliad. And yet neither the
                        precedents of epic poetry nor his purpose of celebrating the national glory
                        of Rome permitted him to leave this part of his task unattempted. To
                        describe a battle or a single combat in the spirit and with the
                        fellow-feeling of Homer has been granted to no poet since his time. Among
                        modern poets perhaps Scott has approached nearer to him than any other.
                        Among Roman authors, Ennius, who gained distinction as a soldier before he
                        became known as a writer, was more fitted to succeed in such an attempt than
                        the poet whose earliest love was for ‘the fields and woods and running
                        streams among the valleys.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As the comparison of his own epic poem with the greatest of the Greek epics
                        is the probable explanation of Virgil’s own dissatisfaction with the Aeneid,
                        so it is the cause of the adverse criticism to which the poem has been
                        exposed in recent times. Of these adverse criticisms, that expressed by
                        Niebuhr, both in his History of Rome and in his Historical Lectures, was
                        among the earliest. In the former he expresses his belief that Virgil, at
                        the approach of death, wished ‘to destroy what in those solemn moments he
                        could not but view with sadness, as the groundwork of a false
                            reputation<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>.’ In the latter he says, ‘The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg72" id="Pg72" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whole of the Aeneid, from the beginning to the end, is a
                        misconceived idea.’ ‘Virgil is one of the remarkable instances of the way in
                        which a man can miss his true calling. His was lyric poetry.’ ‘It is a pity
                        that posterity so much overrated the very work which was but a failure<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Although the service rendered to the study of antiquity by the historical
                        insight of Niebuhr is probably as great as that rendered by the genius of
                        any scholar of this century, yet the opinions expressed by him on literature
                        are often more arbitrary than authoritative. Still this verdict on the
                        merits of the Aeneid was in accordance with the most advanced criticism of
                        the time when it was written, both in Germany and England. The writer by
                        whom the critical taste of England was most stimulated and enlarged about
                        the same time was Coleridge; and in his ‘Table Talk’ such disparaging dicta
                        as this occur more than once: ‘If you take from Virgil his diction and
                        metre, what do you leave him?’ The whole tone of the criticism which arose
                        out of the admiration of German thought and poetry was thoroughly opposed to
                        the spirit in which Latin literature had been admired. Mr. Carlyle also
                        expressed in one of his earliest works—the Life of Schiller—an estimate of
                        the value of Virgil, which was not uncommon among younger scholars at the
                        Universities some thirty years ago. ‘Virgil and Horace,’ he writes, ‘he
                        (Schiller) learned to construe accurately, but is said to have taken no deep
                        interest in their poetry. The tenderness and meek beauty of the first, the
                        humour and sagacity and capricious pathos of the last, the matchless
                        elegance of both would of course escape his inexperienced perception; while
                        the matter of their writings must have appeared frigid and shallow to a mind
                        so susceptible.’ Even the warmest admirers of Virgil about that time, such
                        as Keble, are content to claim for him high excellence as the poet of
                        outward nature. The late Professor Conington, while showing the finest
                        appreciation of ‘the marvellous grace and delicacy, the evidences of a
                        culture most elaborate and most refined,’ in the poet to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg73" id="Pg73" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>interpretation of whose works he devoted the best
                        years of a scholar’s life, has questioned ‘the appropriateness of the
                        special praise given to Virgil’s agricultural poetry, and conceded though
                        with more hesitation to his pastoral compositions.’ He speaks also of it as
                        an admitted fact that ‘in undertaking the Aeneid at the command of a
                        superior, Virgil was venturing beyond the province of his genius.’ And he
                        describes this disparaging estimate as the opinion ‘which is now generally
                        entertained on Virgil’s claims as an epic poet<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>.’ Mr. Keightley is also quoted
                        by him as speaking of Virgil as ‘perhaps the least original poet of
                            antiquity<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>.’ It is
                        certainly not in the spirit of an ardent admirer that the author of Virgil’s
                        life in the ‘Dictionary of Classical Biography and Mythology’ approaches the
                        criticism of his poetry. But it is by German critics and scholars that
                        Virgil’s claim to a high rank among the poets of the world is at the present
                        day most seriously impugned. Thus to take two or three conspicuous instances
                        of their disparaging criticism: Mommsen in his History of Rome<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> speaks contemptuously of the
                        ‘successes of the Aeneid, the Henriade, and the Messiad;’ Bernhardy in his
                            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grundriss der Römischen Litteratur</span></span> (1871) brings
                        together a formidable list of German critics and commentators unfavourable
                        to the merits of the Aeneid, in which the illustrious name of Hegel appears;
                        Gossrau in his edition of the Aeneid quotes from Richter (as a specimen of
                        the unfavourable opinions pronounced by many critics) the expression of a
                        wish that, with the exception of the descriptions and episodes, the rest of
                        the poem had been burned<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a>; and W. S. Teuffel, among other
                        criticisms which ‘damn with faint praise,’ has the following: ‘Aber er ist
                        zu weich und zu wenig genial als dass er auf dem seiner Natur zusagendsten
                        Gebiete hätte beharren und darauf Ruhm ernten können.’ </p>
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span>
                    <a name="Pg74" id="Pg74" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chief, as well as the most obvious, cause of the revolt against Virgil’s
                        poetical pre-eminence, which, though yielding apparently to a revived
                        sentiment of admiration, has not yet spent its force, is the great advance
                        made in Greek scholarship in England and Germany during the present century.
                        Familiarity with Latin literature is probably not less common than it was a
                        century ago, but it is much less common relatively to familiarity with the
                        older literature. The attraction of the latter has been greater from its
                        novelty, its originality, its higher intrinsic excellence, its profounder
                        relation to the heart and mind of man. The art of Homer and that of
                        Theocritus are felt to be an immediate reproduction from human life and
                        outward nature; the art of Virgil seems, at first sight, to be only a
                        reproduction from this older and truer copy. The Roman and Italian character
                        of his workmanship, the new result produced by the recasting of old
                        materials, the individual and inalienable quality of his own genius, were
                        for a time obscured, as the evidences of the large debt which he owed to his
                        Greek masters became more and more apparent. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again, the greater nearness of the Augustan Age, not in time only but in
                        spirit and manners, to our own age, which in the last century told in
                        Virgil’s favour in the comparison with Homer, tells the other way now. The
                        critics of last century were interested in other ages, in so far as they
                        appeared to be like their own. The rude vigour and stirring incident of the
                        Homeric Age or the Middle Ages had no attraction for men living under the
                            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">régime</span></span> of Louis XIV. and XV. or of Queen Anne and
                        the first Georges. What an illustrious living Frenchman says of the great
                        representative of French ideas in the last century might be said generally
                        of its criticism. ‘Voltaire,’ says M. Renan, ‘understood neither the Bible,
                        nor Homer, nor Greek art, nor the ancient religions, nor Christianity, nor
                        the Middle Ages<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a>.’ And yet he was prepared to pronounce his
                        judgment on them by the light of that admirable common <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg75" id="Pg75" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sense which he applied to the questions of his own day. One
                        of the great gains of the nineteenth century over former centuries consists
                        in its more vital knowledge of the past. The imaginative interest now felt
                        in times of nascent and immature civilisation all tells in favour of Homer
                        and against Virgil. The scientific study of human development also tends
                        more and more to awaken interest in a remote antiquity. Even the ages
                        antecedent to all civilisation have a stronger attraction for the
                        adventurous spirit of modern enquiry than the familiar aspect of those
                        epochs in which human culture and intelligence have reached their highest
                        level. This new direction given to imaginative and speculative curiosity,
                        while greatly enhancing the interest felt, not in the Iliad and Odyssey
                        only, but in the primitive epics of various races, has proportionately
                        lowered that felt in the literary epics belonging to times of advanced
                        civilisation. Recognising the radical difference between the two kinds of
                        representation, some recent criticism refuses to the latter altogether the
                        title of epic poetry, and relegates it to some province of imitative and
                        composite art. There is a similar tendency in the present day to be
                        interested in varieties of popular speech,—in language before it has become
                        artistic. Both tendencies are good in so far as they serve to draw attention
                        to neglected fields of knowledge. They are false and mischievous in so far
                        as they lead to the disparagement of the great works of cultivated eras, or
                        to any forgetfulness of the superior grace, richness, and power which are
                        imparted to ordinary speech by the labours of intellect and imagination
                        employed in creating a national literature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Other causes connected with a great expansion of human interests acting on
                        the imagination, and with the revolt against the prevailing poetical style,
                        which arose about the beginning of the present century, have tended to lower
                        the authority of writers who formed the standard of taste to previous ages.
                        The desire of the new era was to escape from the exhausted atmosphere of
                        literary tradition, and to return again to the simplicity of Nature and
                        human feeling. The genius of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg76" id="Pg76" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Roman
                        literature is more in harmony with eras of established order, of adherence
                        to custom, of distinct but limited insight into the outward world and into
                        human life, than to eras of expansive energy, of speculative change, of
                        vague striving to attain some new ideal of duty or happiness. The genius of
                        Greece exercised a powerful influence on several of the great English and
                        German poets who lived in the new era. But neither Goethe nor Schiller,
                        Byron nor Scott, Shelley nor Keats were at all indebted, in thought,
                        sentiment, or expression, to the poets of the Augustan Age. Among the great
                        poets of this new era the only one known to have greatly admired Virgil, and
                        who in his poems founded on classical subjects was influenced by him, is the
                        one who most decidedly proclaimed his revolt against the artificial diction
                        and representation of the school of classical imitators,—the poet
                        Wordsworth. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The very perfection of Virgil’s art, combined with the calmness and
                        moderation of his spirit, was out of harmony with the genius of such a time.
                        He seemed to have nothing new to teach the eager generation which regarded
                        the world and speculated on its own destiny with feelings altogether unlike
                        to those of the generations that went before it. The truth of his sentiment,
                        its adaptation to the spiritual movement of his own age, in which it gained
                        ascendency like a new revelation, had caused it to pass into the modes of
                        thought and feeling habitual to the world. This too may be said of the
                        ethical feeling and common sense of Cicero’s philosophical treatises. Moral
                        speculation has been so long and so deeply permeated by the thought
                        expressed in these treatises that it now appears trite and common-place. So
                        too the moderation and unfailing propriety of Virgil’s language had no
                        attraction of freshness or novelty to stimulate the imagination. The direct
                        force of language in Homer or Lucretius never can become trite or
                        common-place. It affects the mind now as powerfully and immediately as in
                        the day of its creation. There is also a kind of rhetorical style which
                        produces its effect either of pleasure or distaste immediately. It does not
                        conceal its true character, but tries to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg77" id="Pg77" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>force the reader’s admiration by startling imagery, or strained emphasis,
                        or tricks of allusive periphrasis. Whether this style is admired or
                        detested, it does not lose its character with the advance of years. Juvenal
                        and Persius probably affect their readers in much the same way as they did
                        three centuries or seventeen centuries ago. But this is not the style of
                        Virgil and of Horace. They produce their effect neither through that direct
                        force which causes a thought to penetrate or an image to rise up immediately
                        before the mind, nor by strained efforts at rhetorical effect. As their
                        language became assimilated with the thought and feeling of successive
                        generations, it may have lost something of the colouring of sentiment and
                        association, of the delicate shades of meaning, of the vital force which it
                        originally possessed. It has entered into the culture of the world chiefly
                        through impressions produced in early youth, when the mind, though
                        susceptible of graceful variations of words and harmonious effects of
                        rhythm, is too immature to realise fulness of meaning half-concealed by the
                        well-tempered beauty and musical charm of language. The style of Virgil is
                        the fruit of long reflection, and it requires long reflection and
                        familiarity to draw out all its meaning. The word ‘meditari,’ applied by him
                        to his earlier art, expresses the process through which his mind passed in
                        acquiring its mastery over words. In apprehending the charm of his style it
                        is not of the spontaneous fertility of Nature that we think, but of the
                        harvest yielded to assiduous labour by a soil at once naturally rich and
                        obedient to cultivation—‘iustissima tellus.’ These characteristics of his
                        art were not unlikely to be overlooked in an age which demanded from the
                        literature of imagination a rapid succession of varied and powerful
                        impressions. </p>

                        Virgil was held were only temporary in their operation, yet it can hardly be
                        doubted that his claim to pre-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg78" id="Pg78" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>eminence in
                        Latin literature and to a high rank among the greatest poets of all times
                        must, if put forward at all, be maintained on somewhat different grounds
                        from those on which his position formerly rested. He never again can enter
                        into rivalry with Homer as the inspired poet of heroic action. He cannot
                        again enjoy the advantage of being widely known, while access to his
                        predecessor is confined to a few scholars not much in sympathy with the poet
                        of an age so far separated from their own. The art of Virgil in so far as it
                        is a copy of the art of Homer has already produced all the effect on the
                        culture of the world which it is destined to produce. The life of the heroic
                        age will continue to be known to all future times as it was originally
                        fashioned by the creative mind of Homer, not as it was modified by the
                        after-thought of Virgil. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What charm Virgil had for his countrymen as the reviver of the early poetry
                        of Greece and as the first creator of the early romance of Italy, what
                        permanent value he has as one of the great interpreters of the secret of
                        Nature and of the meaning of human life, will appear in the course of the
                        detailed examination of his various poems. But there are some
                        considerations, from an historical point of view, which may be stated
                        provisionally as grounds for assigning to him the place of most importance
                        in Latin literature. He is, more than any other Latin writer, a
                        representative writer,—representative both of the general national idea and
                        of the sentiment and culture of his own age. One clear note of this
                        representative character is that he absorbs and supersedes so much of what
                        went before him, and that he anticipates and also supersedes much that came
                        after him. The interest which Rome and Italy have for all times, the
                        interest which the Augustan Age has as the epoch of the maturest
                        civilisation of ancient times and as a great turning-point in the history of
                        mankind, will secure the attention of the world to an author who sets before
                        it, in forms of pure art and with elaborate workmanship, the idealised
                        spectacle of the marvellous career of Rome, and best enables it to feel the
                        charm of natural beauty and ancient memories asso<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg79" id="Pg79" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ciated with Italy; and who has interpreted, as no one else
                        has done, the meaning and tendency of his age, and of the change which was
                        then preparing for the human spirit and for the nations of the future. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> (1.) The Aeneid brings home to us, in a way in which no other work of Latin
                        literature can do, all those elements in the idea of the destiny, the
                        genius, and character of Rome which most powerfully move the imagination,
                        while it enables us for a time to forget those elements of hardness,
                        unscrupulous injustice, and oppressive domination on which the historian is
                        forced to dwell, and which alienate the sympathies as much as her nobler
                        aspect compels the admiration of mankind. The grandeur and dignity of the
                        Imperial State appear softened and mellowed by Virgil’s marvellous art and
                        humane feeling. ‘The Aeneid,’ says Hallam, ‘reflects the glory of Rome as
                        from a mirror<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>.’ ‘It remains,’ says Mr. Merivale, ‘the most
                        complete picture of the national mind at its highest elevation, the most
                        precious document of national history, if the history of an age is revealed
                        in its ideas, no less than in its events and incidents<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a>.’ ‘Virgile,’ writes M. Sainte-Beuve, ‘a
                        été le poëte du Capitole<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>.’ ‘Dans
                        ce poëme,’ writes M. de Coulanges of the Aeneid, ‘ils (les Romains) se
                        voyaient, eux, leur fondateur, leur ville, leurs institutions, leurs
                        croyances, leur Empire<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>.’ M. Patin
                        again describes the same poem as ‘expression de Rome, de Rome entière, de la
                        Rome de tous les temps, de celle des Empereurs, des Consuls, des Rois<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a>.’ He might have added
                        that it had anticipated the idea of the Rome of the Popes, in some at least
                        of its aspects. The type of character which Virgil has conceived in Aeneas
                        is more like that of the milder among the spiritual rulers of mediaeval Rome
                        than that either of the Homeric heroes or of the actual Consuls and
                        Imperators who commanded the Roman armies and administered the affairs of
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg80" id="Pg80" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Roman State. It has been said of
                        him by another Frenchman that he was more fitted to be the founder of an
                        order of monks than of an Empire. Virgil’s object is to make his readers
                        believe in the mission of Rome, as appointed by Divine decree, for the
                        ultimate peace and good government of the world. The work of Rome in the
                        past, the present, and the future is conceived by him as a manifestation of
                        the Deity in his justice, authority, and beneficence. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> (2.) The spell which Rome exercises over the imagination is quite distinct
                        from the charm which the thought of Italy has for the hearts of men. The
                        love of Italy was a sentiment as deeply rooted in Virgil’s nature as his
                        pride in Rome. This sentiment pervades all his works and inspires some of
                        his noblest poetry. In his pastoral poems, under all the borrowed imagery of
                        the Greek idyl, it reveals itself in his sensibility to the beauty of the
                        Italian climate (‘caeli indulgentia’), to the charm of the various seasons,
                        to the distinctive graces of the plants and wild flowers native to the soil,
                        and in the expression of the deep attachment with which the
                        peasant-proprietor clung to his little plot of ground as the sphere alike of
                        his cares and of his happiness. In the Aeneid this patriotic feeling shows
                        itself, as a similar feeling shows itself in the poetry of Scott, in the
                        enthusiasm with which the martial memories of famous towns and tribes are
                        recalled in association with the picturesque features of the land. But by no
                        work of art, ancient or modern, is the complete impression, moral and
                        physical, of the old Italian land and people,— </p>

                        Georgics. To express the whole meaning of Italy, it was necessary that the
                        poet should feel a pride in her stubborn industry<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> as well as in her
                        warlike energy; that he should <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg81" id="Pg81" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cherish for
                        the whole land, now united as one nation, an impartial love; and that he
                        should be deeply susceptible of that beauty of season and landscape which
                        was a more self-sufficing source of pleasure<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> to the cultivated Italian than even to the ancient Greek.
                        Some sympathy with the ‘Itala virtus’—the courage and discipline of the
                        Marsian and other Sabellian races—Ennius had already expressed in his
                        national epic; but he was interested solely in military and political life,
                        in the activity of the camp and battle-field, the forum and senate-house.
                        Virgil was the first and the only Roman poet to realise the full inspiration
                        of that thought, to which he gives utterance in the close of one of his
                        noblest passages,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> (3.) Virgil has also found a truer poetical expression than any other for
                        the political feeling and tendency of his time. He could not indeed teach
                        the whole lesson of the early Empire, or foresee, in the prosperity and
                        glory that followed the battle of Actium, the oppression experienced under
                        the rule of Tiberius, the degradation experienced under Nero. But his
                        imagination was moved by all those influences which, in the Augustan Age,
                        were giving a new impulse and direction to human affairs. His poems, better
                        than any other witnesses, enable us to understand how weary the Roman world
                        was of the wars, disturbances, and anarchy of the preceding century, how
                        ardently it longed for the restoration of order and national unity, how
                        thankfully it accepted the rule of the man who could alone effect this
                        restoration, and how hopefully it looked forward to a new era of peace and
                        prosperity, of glory and empire, under his administration. The poetry of
                        Virgil co-operated with the policy of the Emperor in the work effected in
                        that age. As Augustus professed to give a new organisation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg82" id="Pg82" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the political life of the Republic, Virgil gave
                        a new direction to its spiritual life, a new significance to its ancient
                        traditions. Augustus, in depriving Rome of her liberty, confirmed for
                        centuries her empire over the world: Virgil, in abnegating the independent
                        position of Lucretius and Catullus, established the ascendency of Roman
                        culture and ideas for a still longer time. As Augustus shaped the policy,
                        Virgil moulded the political feeling of the future. It is in his poems that
                        loyalty to one man, which soon became, and, till a comparatively recent
                        period, continued to be the master-force in European politics,—apparently a
                        necessary stage in the ultimate evolution of free national life on a large
                        scale,—finds its earliest expression. And the loyalty of Virgil is not
                        merely a natural emotion towards one who is regarded as the embodiment of
                        law as well as of power, but is a religious acknowledgment of a government,
                        sanctioned and directed by the Divine will. Perhaps one reason why he is
                        read with less sympathy in the present than in previous centuries, is that
                        his political ideal appears to us a lower ideal than that of a free
                        Commonwealth. But in Virgil’s time faith in the Republic had become
                        impracticable, and, though the sentiment continued to ennoble the life of
                        individuals, it was powerless to change the current of events. Loyalty to a
                        person appealed to the imagination with the charm of novelty, and might be
                        justified to the conscience of the world, as being, for that time and the
                        times that came after, the necessary bond of civil order and union. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> (4.) As Virgil first expressed the political tendency of his age, so he is
                        the purest exponent of its ethical and religious sensibility. He recalls the
                        simpler virtues of the olden time, he represents the humanity of his own
                        age, he anticipates something of the piety and purity of the future faith of
                        the world. As in the development of Roman law, the spirit of equity fostered
                        by Greek studies gradually gained ascendency over the native hardness of the
                        Roman temper, so, from the time of Laelius and the younger Scipio, the
                        expansion through intellectual culture of the humane and sympathetic
                        emotions, ex<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg83" id="Pg83" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pressed by the word
                        ‘humanitas,’ continued to prevail, in opposition to the spirit of national
                        exclusiveness habitual to the Roman aristocracy, and in spite of the cruel
                        experience of the Civil Wars. In no writers is this quality more conspicuous
                        than in Cicero and in Lucretius. In Lucretius this feeling inspires his
                        passionate revolt against the ancient religions. The humane feeling of
                        Virgil, on the other hand, is in complete harmony with his religious belief.
                        His word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pietas</span></span>, as is observed by M. Sainte-Beuve,
                        is the equivalent both of our ‘piety’ and of our ‘pity.’ The Power above man
                        is regarded by him not as an unreal phantom created by our fears, but as the
                        source and sanction of justice and mercy, of good will and good faith among
                        men. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This view of the relation between the supernatural world and human life is
                        not indeed the only one which Virgil shows us. He endeavours, by the union
                        of imagination, philosophy, and tradition, to establish religious opinion as
                        well as to kindle religious emotions; nor is he quite successful in
                        reconciling these various factors of belief. The ‘Fates,’ which are the
                        medium through which man’s happiness or misery is allotted, are sometimes
                        stern and inflexible, as well as beneficent in their action. They accomplish
                        their purposes with no regard to individual rights or feelings. But though
                        Virgil failed, as much as other exponents of religious systems, in
                        reconciling the necessities of his creed with the instincts of human
                        sensibility, it remains true that in regard to much both of his feeling and
                        intuition, in his firm faith in Divine Providence, in his conviction of the
                        spiritual essence in man and of its independence of and superiority to the
                        body, in his belief that the future state of the soul depends on the deeds
                        done in the body, in his sense of sin and purification for sin, in the value
                        which he attaches to purity and sanctity of life, his spirit is much more in
                        unison with the faith and hopes which were destined to prevail over the
                        world, than with the common beliefs or half-beliefs of his own time. In his
                        religious and ethical, no less than his political sentiment, ‘il a deviné à
                        une heure décisive du monde ce <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg84" id="Pg84" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>qu’aimerait
                        l’avenir.’ If it was as a great national poet, the rival of Homer, Hesiod,
                        and Theocritus, that he exercised the most powerful spell over his
                        contemporaries, it was rather as the ‘pius vates,’ the prophetic teacher,
                        that, in spite of themselves, he gained ascendency over the cultivated minds
                        of the early Latin and the mediaeval Churches<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> (5.) Though other periods of ancient history, and notably the fifth century
                        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> in Greece, were richer in genius and enjoyed a happier and nobler life
                        than the Augustan Age, yet this latter age, as the latest of the great
                        literary epochs of antiquity, inherited the science, wisdom, power, and
                        beauty stored up in all the art and writings of the past. The Augustan Age
                        was pre-eminently an age of culture, and Virgil was pre-eminently the most
                        cultivated man belonging to the age. In early youth he had learned from
                        Greek masters all they could teach him in poetry and rhetoric, in science
                        and philosophy; and through all his life he combined the productive labours
                        of an artist with the patient diligence of a student. He was familiar with
                        the successive schools of Greek poetry, from Homer and Hesiod down to the
                        epic and didactic poets of Alexandria. He was acquainted with all the
                        physical sciences known in his time, especially, it is said, with astronomy
                        and medicine. His earlier writings show the influence of the philosophical
                        system of Epicurus, while his later convictions are more in agreement with
                        the Platonic philosophy. The oratory of the later books of the Aeneid
                        breathes the spirit of Stoicism. We are told that he proposed to devote the
                        years that might remain to him after the completion of the Aeneid to the
                        further study of philosophy, perhaps with the view of writing a great poem,
                        which might rival and answer Lucretius. The extant fragments of Naevius,
                        Ennius, Pacuvius, Attius, and Lucilius, and of later and obscurer writers
                        such as Hostius and Varro Atacinus, show <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg85" id="Pg85" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that he had read their works, and could skilfully adapt what he found in
                        them to his own national epic. The Georgics, again, show a careful study and
                        assimilation of the thought and language of Lucretius. And to the pursuits
                        of a scholar he united the research of an antiquary. He collected from many
                        sources the myths and traditions connected with the origin of ancient
                        customs and ceremonies, or attaching to the towns and tribes of Italy,
                        famous in early times. He was especially well versed in the ceremonial lore
                        of the Priestly Colleges. Thus, in addition to his higher claims on the
                        admiration of his countrymen, his poems were prized by them as a great
                        repertory of their secular and sacred learning. Many fancies and dim
                        traditions of a remote antiquity, many vestiges of customs and ceremonies
                        which have disappeared from the world, many thoughts and expressions of men
                        who have left scarcely any other memorial of themselves, still survive,
                        because the mind of Virgil discerned some element of interest in them which
                        fitted them to contribute to the representative character of the work to
                        which his life was dedicated. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> (6.) Virgil’s pre-eminence as a literary artist and master of poetical
                        expression is so generally acknowledged that it is not necessary to
                        illustrate it in this preliminary statement of the position which he holds
                        in Roman literature. The Augustan Age was characterised by a careful study
                        and application of the principles of art, as well as by an elaborate
                        culture. By the labours and reflection of three or four generations the
                        Latin language had been gradually changed from a rude Italian dialect into a
                        great organ of law, government, and literature. The efforts of the
                        generation preceding the Augustan Age to attain to perfection in form and
                        style received their fulfilment in the work accomplished by Virgil and
                        Horace. Each of them, in his own way, obtained a complete success; but the
                        sustained perfection of a long poem, epic or didactic, is a much greater
                        result than the perfection shown in the composition of an ode. Virgil, alone
                        among his countrymen, discerned the true conditions in accordance with which
                        a long continuous poem, epic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg86" id="Pg86" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or didactic,
                        could as a whole gain, and permanently retain, the ear of the world: and, in
                        accordance with these conditions, he worked the various materials,
                        descriptive, meditative, narrative, and commemorative, of the Georgics and
                        Aeneid into poems of large compass, sustained interest, and finished
                        execution. His style marks the maturity of development after which the vital
                        force animating the growth of the Latin language begins to decay. One of the
                        most sensible causes of this decay in the idiomatic structure of the
                        language both of verse and prose is the predominance of Virgil’s influence
                        over the later writers. He and Horace introduced into Latin all that it
                        could well bear of the subtlety and flexibility which characterise the Greek
                        tongue. When first introduced, this infusion of a new force into the Latin
                        language, modifying the use of words and altering the structure of
                        sentences, probably appeared to the literary class at Rome a new source of
                        wealth, colouring words and phrases with the gleam of old poetic
                        association. But this new infusion, though an immediate source of wealth,
                        tended to corrupt the pure current of native speech. The later poetical
                        style of Rome never regains the lucidity and volume which it has in
                        Lucretius, or the ease and sparkling flow of Catullus. The maturity of
                        accomplishment immediately preceded and partly occasioned the decay in vital
                        force. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In other arts the maturest excellence often foreruns a rapid and inevitable
                        decline. One cause of this seems to be, that the great masters, having once
                        for all expressed in the happiest manner whatever is best worth expressing
                        within the range and vision of their own era, leave to their successors the
                        choice of tamely imitating them or of striving to gain attention, by a
                        strained way of expressing it, for what is not worth expressing in any way.
                        Into the first of these pitfalls the imitative poets of the Flavian era
                        sank; the more ambitious <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">littérateurs</span></span> of the Neronian
                        Age fell into the second. Another cause of the close connexion between the
                        maturity and the decay of art is that the representation of man and Nature
                        produced by a great master is coloured by his own thought and feeling. The
                            repre<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg87" id="Pg87" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sentation thus established gains
                        ascendency over the future. Each new reproduction of this departs further
                        from reality. Art becomes thoroughly conventional. It revives only after a
                        new range of interests, some vital change in belief and ideas, has arisen in
                        the evolution of national life, accompanied by a new birth of original
                        genius, and powerful enough to divert the minds of men from the
                        contemplation of the old to the novel spectacle of the world in which they
                        live. The emotions thus excited force out for themselves a fresh channel:
                        the sound of poetry is again heard in the land, and the hearts of men are
                        refreshed:— </p>

                        Virgil in the literature of his country was too powerful, to permit the
                        appearance of any new spring of Latin poetry. </p>

                        country and his age entitle him to a place among the greatest poets of the
                        world, will be answered variously according to the degree in which men
                        recognise in him the presence of that diviner faculty of imagination which
                        no analysis can explain. If we look to him for the original force of
                        creative imagination which we find in Homer, Aeschylus, and Sophocles on the
                        one hand, and in the greatest poets of modern times on the other, we shall
                        fail to establish his equality with them. But as there have been various
                        types of philosophical intellect in the world, so there have been various
                        types <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg88" id="Pg88" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of imaginative power. And among these
                        types we may distinguish those characteristic of the Hellenic, the Germanic,
                        and the Italian races. The genius of the ancient Latin race is further
                        removed from that of the modern Germanic race, than either is from the
                        genius of ancient Greece. The peculiar richness of our own poetic literature
                        arises from its combining some of the great characteristics of each type.
                        While Scott and Byron, for instance, are among the greatest representatives
                        of the purely modern imagination, the works of Pope and Gray are essentially
                        of the Latin type; and those of Dryden, Milton, and Spenser blend Roman
                        strength or the culture of Latin ideas with English boldness and modern
                        exuberance of fancy: while, again, Shelley, Keats, and all the greatest
                        among our living poets have received a powerful impulse from Greek art and
                        Greek ideas. It must be admitted by students of Latin literature that the
                        intellectual movement and sensibility of the present time has a closer
                        affinity with the ancient Greek than with the ancient Latin culture.
                        Students of Homer and Aeschylus, as well as those who have once felt the

                        Shelley, find, in turning to Virgil, that their range of feeling and of
                        contemplation has become narrower. They no longer enjoy the same illimitable
                        prospect, they no longer breathe the same keen air, which buoyed them up on
                        the higher altitudes of poetry. Greek and modern works of imagination
                        manifest a profounder feeling, a more varied contemplation of the mystery of
                        life, than is compatible with the more realistic tendencies of Latin poetry.
                        And though the representation of the outward world in Virgil is, in its
                        serene beauty, suggestive of a secret unceasing life which appeals to the
                        human spirit in its more tranquil moods, yet it does not move the mind to
                        that profounder sense of an affinity between the soul of man and the soul of
                        Nature which the great modern poets awaken. The charm and power of Latin
                        poetry consists, for the most part, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg89" id="Pg89" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the
                        vital strength of feeling with which it invests a limited and definite range
                        of interests. What the Roman poets cared for they cared for with all their
                        heart, and strength, and mind. They seem to have written from more enduring,
                        if less abundant, sources of affection than other poets. Their hearts
                        thoroughly realised what they idealised in imagination. This strong realism
                        and constancy of feeling explains the labour with which they perfected their
                        art, as the strong love of his small portion of land explains the labour
                        which the ideal husbandman of the Georgics bestows on it. Through that
                        vividness of feeling with which they cherished the thought of what gave
                        actual joy to their lives, Catullus and Horace were able to invest the names
                        of Sirmio, of Lucretilis and Digentia, with an interest which attaches to
                        the favourite residences of no other poets: though perhaps future
                        generations will find a similar classic charm attaching to the homes of
                        Wordsworth and of Scott, and to the hills, dales, and streams which they
                        have endowed with the wealth of their strong affection. The human objects of
                        their passionate love excited in several of the Roman poets this same vital
                        warmth of feeling. The ‘spirat adhuc amor’ is still true of all the poetry
                        which the love of Lesbia and of Cynthia inspired. Even Ovid, whose want of
                        seriousness and profound feeling is the chief flaw in his poetic
                        temperament, had the most vivid sense of the pleasure and of the pain of his
                        own existence. It is this capacity in the imagination of being vitally
                        interested in and possessed by its object, which enabled Lucretius to
                        breathe the breath of enduring life into the dry bones of the atomic
                        philosophy. And that this strong realism of feeling is a characteristic of
                        the race to which these poets belonged is proved by the pathetic force of
                        the numerous sepulchral epitaphs of persons altogether undistinguished,
                        preserved from the times of the early Empire. It is owing to the power of
                        producing a strong and abiding impression that Latin has retained the
                        function of being the language of great epitaphs and of great inscriptions
                        in modern times. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil too possessed this gift of vividly realising the objects <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg90" id="Pg90" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which interested him; and his singularly receptive
                        nature enabled him to feel a much larger number of interests than the other
                        poets of his country. What his speculative system was to Lucretius in its
                        power of concentrating on itself all his capacity of feeling; what ‘Lesbia’
                        and ‘Sirmio’ and the few objects associated with the happiness and pain of
                        his life were to Catullus; what the valley in the Sabine hills was to
                            Horace<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>; what Cynthia in life and death was to Propertius;
                        what the remembrance of past joy in the midst of sorrow was to Ovid; that
                        the thought of Rome and the memories associated with it, the charm of the
                        land and air of Italy, the strength and sanctity of human affection, the
                        mystery of the unseen world, were to Virgil. The necessities of his art
                        require him to introduce into his poem materials which touch his own nature
                        less deeply, and which come to him through the reflex action of literary
                        association; and these, though he always treats them gracefully, he does not
                        invest with the same sense of reality. But when his imagination is moved by
                        the thought of Rome, of Italy, of a remote antiquity, of human affection, of
                        the unseen world, then his art becomes truly and vividly creative. The depth
                        of feeling with which these things affect him reveals itself in the blended
                        majesty and sweetness, the tenderness and pathos of his tones, occasionally
                        in some more solemn cadence and a kind of mystic yearning. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If a return to the high admiration once felt for Virgil involved any
                        detraction from the high admiration with which the great poets of Greece and
                        of the modern world are regarded, anything like his claims to his old rank
                        would generally be set aside. If for no other reason, yet because they have
                        more in common with the general ideas and movement of the modern world,
                        these last-named poets have a stronger hold on students of literature in the
                        present day. But, happily, the ‘sacrum litterarum studium’—to use a phrase
                        of Macrobius—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg91" id="Pg91" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the religion of the world of
                        letters, is not a jealous or intolerant faith. The object of that religion
                        is to keep alive the sentiment of reverence for every kind of excellence
                        which has appeared in the literature of the world. That Virgil was once the
                        object of the greatest reverence is a reason for not lightly putting his
                        claims aside now. In our study of the great writers of old, it is well to
                        realise the true lesson taught in the sad beauty of the lines,— </p>

                        Though the thoughts of the Latin poet may not help us to understand the
                        spirit of our own era, they are a bond of union with the genius and culture
                        of Europe in other times. If poetry ever exercises a healing and reconciling

                        especially that the imaginative art of Virgil, in comparison with the
                        imaginative art of other great poets, is most questioned, they may be

                        of antiquity are their own writings, and accidental notices in the works of
                        contemporaries and writers of a succeeding generation. But besides these
                        sources of information some short biographies of eminent Latin writers,
                        written long after their deaths, have reached modern times. In cases where
                        their actual biographies have been lost, fragments or summaries of them have
                        been preserved in Jerome’s continuation of the Eusebian Chronicle, and
                        occasionally in commentaries or scholia appended to their own works. Roman
                        literature from a comparatively early period produced a large number of
                        grammarians, commentators, and rhetoricians. In the Ciceronian Age, Varro
                        wrote several books on literary history and the earlier poets; and Cornelius
                        Nepos included in his Biographies the lives of men of letters, among others
                        of his own contemporary, Atticus. Jerome, in the prefatory letter to his own
                        work ‘De Viris Illustribus<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>,’ mentions the names of Varro, Santra, Nepos,
                        Hyginus, and Suetonius as authors of literary biography, and proposes to
                        follow in his own work the precedent set by the last of these authors. Of
                        the work of Suetonius ‘De Viris Illustribus,’ written in the second century,
                        and containing the lives of eminent poets, orators, historians,
                        philosophers, grammarians, and rhetoricians, considerable portions have been
                        preserved; among others complete biographies of Terence and Horace. This
                        work became the chief authority <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg94" id="Pg94" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to later
                        commentators for the facts recorded about the earlier Roman poets, and was
                        the source from which Jerome himself drew the materials for the continuation
                        of the Eusebian Chronicle. The question remains as to how far Suetonius
                        himself writing under the rule of Hadrian, is a trustworthy authority for
                        the lives of poets who lived nearly two centuries before his own era. The
                        answer to this question will depend on the access which he may have had to
                        contemporary sources, transmitted to his time through an uninterrupted
                        channel, and on the evidence of credulity or trustworthiness in accepting or
                        rejecting gossip and scandalous anecdotes which his other writings afford.
                        He appears to have been diligent in his examination of original authorities.
                        On the other hand, his ‘Lives of the Caesars’ indicate a vein of credulity
                        in regard to the details of unverifiable charges at which Tacitus only hints
                        by general innuendo. But the main question in regard to the life of each
                        particular poet is, whether there was in existence written evidence dating
                        from contemporary sources on which Suetonius could have based his narrative.
                        In the case of some poets, notably of Virgil, it is quite certain that there
                        was such evidence. In the case of others, notably of Lucretius, there is no
                        hint whatever of the existence of any such evidence. The poets who
                        immediately succeeded him and who were diligent students of his poem concur
                        in absolute silence as to the story of that poet’s unhappy fate, told in the
                        continuation of the Eusebian Chronicle, and now received by the most
                        competent critics as resting on the authority of Suetonius. But even when we
                        substitute Suetonius for Jerome as the original voucher for the facts
                        stated, the uncertainty as to any contemporary evidence available to the
                        former, and the sensational character of the story itself, justify at least
                        a suspense of judgment in accepting or rejecting this meagre fragment of
                        personal history; while on the other hand there is no ground for distrusting
                        the main features, whatever may be said of some details, of the ancient life
                        of Virgil, equally acknowledged to rest ultimately on the authority of
                        Suetonius. </p>

                        images impressed on gems, or other kinds of portraiture. But in the case of
                        men of letters, it is not often that reliance can be placed on the

                        characteristics of Virgil are supplied partly by direct statements contained
                        in his poems or inferences founded on them; partly by the indirect
                        impression of himself stamped on these poems; partly by casual notices in
                        the works of other poets, and especially of Horace; and partly by statements

                        Donatus,—a grammarian who flourished in the fourth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>,—and founded on, if not an actual

                        genuine. A fragment of a prose letter to Augustus has been preserved by
                        Macrobius, which confirms the traditional account of the poet’s estimate of
                        the Aeneid and of his devotion in later life to philosophical studies<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>. The Eclogues and Georgics add something
                        to our information, but as the representation in the first of these works is
                        for the most part dramatic, and as the purpose of the second is purely
                        didactic, the evidence they supply is much less vivid and direct than that
                        supplied by Horace, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg96" id="Pg96" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Catullus, and the
                        elegiac poets in regard to their lives and pursuits; and even where the
                        allusions to matters personal to himself are unmistakeable, they require to
                        be interpreted by knowledge derived from other sources. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Georgics and those parts of the Aeneid which are specially ethical and
                        didactic, as that part of Book VI. from line 264 to 751, throw most light on
                        Virgil’s spiritual nature and on his convictions on the questions of most
                        vital interest to man. But in these parts of his works Virgil has not
                        revealed himself with such distinctness and consistency as Lucretius has
                        done in his great philosophical poem. The personality of Lucretius was
                        simpler and more forcible: the passion to utter his strong convictions
                        prevailed in him over all considerations of art. The colouring of his own
                        heart and spirit, of his enthusiasm or melancholy, appears in Virgil rather
                        as a pervading and subtly interpenetrating influence, than as the direct
                        indication of his true self. His artistic taste enforced on him reserve in
                        expressing what was personal to himself; his nature was apparently more open
                        to varied influences of books and men than that of Lucretius; he was endowed
                        with the many-sided susceptibility of a poet, rather than with the simpler,
                        more energetic, but narrower consistency of a philosophical partisan.
                        Equally with Lucretius he throws his whole heart and being into the
                        treatment of his subject; but in Lucretius the two streams of what is
                        personal to himself and what is inherent in his subject are still
                        distinguishable. In Virgil the imaginative sentiment of the poet and the
                        strong tender heart of the man seem to be inseparably united. It would be
                        impossible to distinguish them by analysis,—to abstract from the bloom of
                        his poetry the delicate sweetness which may have pervaded his performance of
                        the common duties and his share in the common intercourse of life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Of the contemporary poets and critics whose works are extant, much the most
                        important witness of the impression produced by Virgil on those with whom he
                        lived is the poet Horace. And he is an admirable witness, from the clearness
                        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg97" id="Pg97" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his judgment, the calmness of his
                        temperament, and the intimate terms of friendship on which he lived with the

                        and while still constant to the attachments of his earlier years, continued
                        through all his life to form new friendships with younger men who gave
                        promise of distinction. His Odes and Epistles are addressed to a great
                        variety of men, to those of highest social or political position, such as
                        Agrippa, Pollio, Munatius Plancus, Sallustius Crispus, Lollius, etc.; to old
                        comrades of his youth or brother poets, such as Pompeius Grosphus,
                        Septimius, Aristius Fuscus, Tibullus; to the men of a younger generation,
                        such as Iulus Antonius, Julius Florus, and the younger Lollius: and to all
                        of them he applies language of discriminating, but not of excessive
                        appreciation. To the men of eminence in the State he uses expressions of
                        courteous and delicate compliment, never of flattery or exaggeration. His
                        old comrades and intimate associates he greets with hearty friendliness or
                        genial irony: to younger men, without assuming the airs of a Mentor, he
                        addresses words of sympathetic encouragement or paternal advice. But among
                        all those whom he addresses there are only two—unless from one or two words
                        implying strong attachment, we add one more to the number, Aelius Lamia—in
                        connexion with whom he uses the language of warm and admiring affection.
                        These are Maecenas and Virgil. Whatever may have been the date or
                        circumstances connected with the composition of the third Ode of Book I.,
                        the simple words ‘animae dimidium meae’ establish the futility <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg98" id="Pg98" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the notion, that the subject of this Ode is not
                        the poet but only the same merchant or physician whom Horace in the twelfth
                        Ode of Book IV. invites, in his most Epicurean style, to sacrifice for a
                        time his pursuit of wealth to the more seasonable claims of the wine of
                        Cales. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Two short Lives of Virgil written in prose have reached our time, one
                        originally prefixed to the Commentary by Valerius Probus, a grammarian of
                        the first century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, the other, much longer and
                        more important, prefixed to that of Donatus. There is also a Life in
                        hexameter verse, written by a grammarian named Phocas, about one half of
                        which is devoted to an account of the marvellous portents that were alleged
                        to have accompanied the birth of the poet. The Life of Donatus was in the
                        later MSS. of Virgil so much corrupted by the intermixture of mediaeval
                        fictions, that it is only in recent times that modern criticism has
                        successfully removed the interpolations, and restored the original Life
                        based on that of Suetonius<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a>. What then were the materials available to
                        Suetonius? The earliest source of his information was a work referred to by
                        Quintilian (x. 3. 8), written by the older contemporary and life-long friend
                        of Virgil, the poet Varius, entitled ‘De ingenio moribusque Vergilii.’ Aulus
                        Gellius (xvii. 10) speaks of the ‘memorials which the friends and intimates
                        of Virgil have left of his genius and character.’ Among those who
                        contributed to the knowledge of his habits, etc., the name of C. Melissus, a
                        freedman of Maecenas, is quoted as an authority for a statement that ‘in
                        ordinary speech he was very slow and almost like an uneducated man’—a trait
                        which calls to mind what is recorded of Addison. Melissus could not fail to
                        be an authority as to the relations of Virgil to Maecenas, and it is
                        probably on his evidence that the statement rests of the direction given to
                        the poet’s genius in the choice of the subject of the Georgics. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A still more important work was that of the grammarian Asconius Pedianus,
                        born at the commencement of our era, who wrote ‘Contra obtrectatores
                        Vergilii.’ These ‘maligners,’ beginning with those whose names have been
                        condemned to everlasting fame, as Bavius and Maevius, had assailed the art
                        of Virgil by flippant parodies, or had traduced his character by
                        imputations, which, though they might have called for no remark if made
                        against any other poet of the time, were believed by those who had the best
                        means of knowing the truth to be incompatible with the finer nature of
                        Virgil. In regard to one of these charges Asconius was able to procure the
                        evidence of an emphatic denial from the only surviving person who could have
                        known anything about the matter<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The certainty that the biographical notices of Virgil and the accounts
                        transmitted of his personal characteristics can be traced to contemporary
                        sources and to information derived from contemporaries, gives to the main
                        statements of Donatus a value which does not attach to the meagre notice of
                        Lucretius preserved in the writings of Jerome. On the other hand, while it
                        is believed by his English Editor that the actual features of Lucretius have
                        been transmitted, engraved on a gem, no reliance can be placed on the
                        authenticity either of the busts, such as that shown in the Capitoline
                        Museum, or of the portraits prefixed to various MSS., and all different from
                        one another, which profess to transmit the likeness of Virgil. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The testimony of inscriptions, of the earliest MSS., and of the Greek
                        rendering of the word, has led to the general adoption in recent times of
                        the name P. Vergilius Maro, as that by which the poet should be known<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>. Yet it is an unnecessary
                        disturbance of old associations to change the abbreviation so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long established in all European literature into
                        the unfamiliar <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vergil</span></span>. He was born on the 15th of
                        October in the year 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, the first consulate
                        of Pompey and Crassus. The Romans attached a peculiar sacredness to their
                        own birth-days and to those of their friends; and the birth-day of Virgil
                        continued long after his death to be regarded with the sanctity of a day of
                            festival<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a>. The year of his birth is the first year of that decade in
                        which many of the men most eminent in the Augustan era were born. Virgil was
                        a little younger than Pollio and Varius; a little older than Gallus,
                        Agrippa, Horace, and Augustus, and perhaps Maecenas. All of these men
                        obtained high distinction, and took their place as leaders of their age in
                        action or literature in early youth. The distinction of Virgil was acquired
                        at a somewhat later period of life than that of any of his illustrious
                        contemporaries. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This year is also important as marking the close of the wars and
                        disturbances which arose out of the first great Civil War, and the
                        commencement of a short interval of repose, though hardly of order or
                        security. Lucretius in his childhood and early youth had witnessed the
                        Social War, the bloody strife of Marius and Sulla, and the prolongation of
                        these troubles in the wars of Sertorius and Spartacus: and the memory of the
                        first Civil War seems to have impressed itself indelibly on his imagination
                        and powerfully to have affected his whole view of human life, as the horrors
                        of the first French Revolution imprinted themselves indelibly on the
                        imagination of those whose childhood had been agitated or made desolate by
                        them. Virgil’s childhood and early youth were passed in the shelter of a
                        quieter time. He had reached manhood before the second of the great storms
                        which overwhelmed the State passed over the Roman world. The alarm and
                        insecurity felt at Rome during the interval may have caused some agitation
                        of the calmer atmosphere which surrounded his childhood; but the peace of
                        his earliest and most impressible years was marred by no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scenes of horror, such as the massacre at the
                        Colline Gate, the memory of which perhaps survives in those lines of
                        Lucretius in which the miseries of a savage life are contrasted with those
                        of times of refinement:— </p>

                        neighbourhood of Mantua. The exact situation of Andes is unknown, though a
                        tradition, as old as the time of Dante, identifies it with the village of
                        Pietola, about three miles lower down the Mincio than Mantua. But it is only
                        in the Life by Probus that Andes is described as a ‘vicus,’ and there it is
                        said to be distant from Mantua ‘xxx milia passuum.’ The word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pagus</span></span>, which is generally used in reference to Andes,
                        never seems to be used as equivalent to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vicus</span></span>, but as
                        a ‘country-district,’ which might include several villages. The tradition
                        which identifies Andes with any particular village in the neighbourhood of
                        Mantua does not therefore carry with it any guarantee of its truth. In the
                        Eclogues the conventional scenery of pastoral poetry is blended so
                        inseparably with the reproduction from actual scenes, that it is impossible
                        to determine with certainty the characteristic features of Virgil’s early
                        home. The immediate neighbourhood of Mantua presents no features to which

                        have been the green banks and slow windings of the Mincio, which he recalls
                        with affectionate memory in passages of the Eclogues and Georgics. From the
                        fact that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the farm on which he lived formed
                        part of the Mantuan land added to the confiscated territory of Cremona, the
                        inference seems obvious that it was on the right bank of the Mincio, i.e.
                        on the side nearest Cremona. The use of the word ‘depellere’ (Ecl. i. 21)
                        might perhaps justify the inference that it was either on higher ground, or
                        was situated higher up the river than Mantua, though the other
                        interpretation of ‘driving our weaned lambs’ forbids our attaching much
                        force to this problematical inference. But the lines which produce more than

                        actual position of the place referred to. The only hills in the
                        neighbourhood of the Mincio to which these lines can apply are those which

                        genius. And though it is easy to push such considerations too far, and to

                        exists between the development of genius and the earliest impression of
                        outward nature on the soul, in a poet like Virgil, unusually receptive and
                        retentive of such impressions, whose days from childhood to death were
                        closely bound ‘each to each by natural piety,’ in whom all elements of
                        feeling were finely and delicately blended with one another, such influences
                        may have been more powerful than in the case of men of a less impressionable
                        and more self-determining type. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The district north of the Po, of which Virgil was a native, had enjoyed the
                        ‘ius Latii’ since the end of the Social War, but did not obtain the full
                        rights of Roman citizenship till the year 49 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>,
                        when Virgil was in his twenty-first year. The national poet of the early
                        Empire, like the national poet of the Republic, had thus in all probability
                        no claim by birth to be a member of the State of whose character and destiny
                        his voice has been the truest exponent. It may be doubted whether Virgil
                        belonged by birth to the purely Italian stock. He claims for Mantua a Tuscan
                            origin<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>; but the Etruscan race
                        in the region north of the Po had for a long time previously given way
                        before the settlements of the Gauls; and, although Roman conquest had
                        established several important colonies north of the Po, the main stock
                        between that river and the Alps must have been of Celtic blood, although
                        assimilated in manner of life and culture to the purely Italian inhabitants
                        of the Peninsula. Zeuss, in his Celtic Grammar, recognises the presence of a
                        Celtic root, which appears in other Gallic names, and which he supposes to
                        be the root also of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">virgo</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">virga</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vergiliae</span></span>, in the name

                        seem to anticipate the developments of modern feeling, as, for instance, his
                        vague melancholy, his imaginative sense of the mystery of the unseen world,
                        his sympathy with the sentiment, as distinct from the passion, of love, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the modes in which his delight in nature
                        manifests itself, the vein of romance which runs through his treatment of
                        early times may perhaps be explained by some subtle intermixture of Celtic
                        blood with the firmer temperament of the old Italian race. Appreciated as
                        his genius has been by all the cultivated nations of Europe, it is by the
                        nation in whom the impressible Celtic nature has been refined and
                        strengthened by the discipline of Latin studies that his pre-eminence has
                        been most generally acknowledged. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is to be noticed that, while in the Ciceronian Age the names of the men
                        eminent in literature belong, with one or two exceptions, either to the pure
                        Roman stock or to the races of central Italy which had been longest
                        incorporated with Rome, in the last years of the Republic and in the
                        Augustan Age Northern Italy contributed among other names those of Catullus,
                        Cornelius Gallus, Quintilius Varus, Aemilius Macer, Virgil, and the
                        historian Livy to the roll of Latin literature. Since the concessions which
                        followed the Social War the whole people inhabiting the Peninsula had become
                        thoroughly united in spirit with the Imperial city, and Latin literature as
                        well as the service of the State thus received a great impulse from the
                        liberality with which Rome, at different stages in her history, extended the
                        privileges of her citizenship. The culture of which Rome had been for two
                        generations the centre became now much more widely diffused; and as the
                        privilege of citizenship, or of that modified citizenship conferred by the
                        ‘ius Latii,’ was more prized from its novelty, so the attractions of
                        literary studies and the impulses of literary ambition were felt more
                        strongly from coming fresh and unhackneyed to a vigorous race. It was a
                        happier position for Virgil and for Horace, it fitted them not only to be
                        truer poets of the natural beauty of Italy, but also to feel in imagination
                        all the wonder associated with the idea of the great city, to have spent
                        their earliest and most impressible years among scenes of peace and beauty,
                        remote from contact with the excitement, the vices, the routine of city
                        life, than if, with the friend of Juvenal, they could have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>applied to themselves the words—‘our childhood
                        drank in the air of the Aventine.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There is still one point to be noticed in connexion with the district in
                        which Virgil was born and passed his early youth. It was from Julius Caesar
                        that Gallia Transpadana received the full Roman citizenship. But before he
                        established this claim on their gratitude, the ‘Transpadani,’ as we learn
                        from Cicero’s letters, were thoroughly devoted to his cause<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>, and it
                        was among them that his legions were mainly recruited. One of the spiteful
                        acts by which the aristocratic party showed its animosity to Caesar was the
                        scourging of one of the inhabitants of the colony of Novum Comum (Como) by
                        order of the Consul Marcellus,—an act condemned by Cicero on the ground
                        that the victim of this outrage was a ‘Transpadanus<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a>.’ Caesar was in the habit of passing the
                        winters of his proconsulate in this part of his province, especially at
                        Verona, where he was the guest of the father of Catullus. The name of Caesar
                        must thus have become a household word among this people. They must have
                        soon recognised his greatness as a soldier, and felt the fascination of his
                        gracious presence. They must have been grateful for his championship of the
                        provinces against the oppressive rule of the Senate, and for the protection
                        afforded by his army from dangers similar to those from which their fathers
                        had been saved, after many disasters, by his great kinsman, Marius. They did
                        not share the sentiments of distrust excited among the aristocracy at Rome
                        by Caesar’s early career, and had no reason to regard the permanent
                        ascendency of one man as a heavier burden than the caprices of their
                        temporary governors. From the favour which Virgil received from leaders of
                        the Caesarean cause before his fame was established, and from his intimacy
                        with Varius the panegyrist of Julius Caesar, it may be inferred that in
                        adhering to the cause of the Empire he was true to the early impressions of
                        his boyhood. He was one of the first to feel and make others feel the spell
                        which the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>name of Caesar was destined
                        henceforth to exercise over the world. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Latin literature in the Augustan Age drew its representatives not only from
                        a wider district than the preceding age, but also from a different social
                        class. The men eminent as poets, orators, and historians in the last years
                        of the Republic were for the most part members of the great Roman or Italian
                        families. They were either themselves actively engaged in political life, or
                        living in intimacy with those who were so engaged. Whatever tincture of
                        letters was found in any other class was confined to freedmen or learned
                        Greeks, such as Archias and Theophanes, attached to the houses of the
                        nobility. The fortunes of the two great poets of the Augustan Age prove that
                        no barrier of class-prejudice and no necessary inferiority of early
                        education prevented free-born men of very humble origin from attaining the
                        highest distinction, and living as the trusted friends of the foremost men
                        in the State. Virgil and Horace were the sons of men who by the thrift and
                        industry of a humble occupation had been able to buy small farms in their
                        native district. Virgil’s father had not indeed, like the father of Horace,
                        risen from a servile position. He is said to have begun life as a hired
                        assistant to one Magius, who, according to one account, was a potter,
                        according to another a ‘viator’ (or officer whose duty it was to summon
                        prisoners before magistrates). He married the daughter of his master, being
                        recommended to him, as is said by his biographer, by his industry (ob
                        industriam). The name of Virgil’s mother was Magia Polla. His father is said
                        to have increased his substance among other things by keeping bees (silvis
                        coemendis et apibus curandis),—a fact which perhaps explains the importance
                        given to this branch of rural industry in the Georgics. Virgil thus springs
                        from that class whose condition he represents as the happiest allotted to
                        man, and as affording the best field for the exercise of virtue and piety.
                        He and Horace, after living in the most refined society of Rome, are
                        entirely at one in their appreciation of the qualities of the old Italian
                        husbandmen or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>small landowners,—a class
                        long before their time reduced in numbers and influence, but still producing
                        men of modest worth and strong common sense like the ‘abnormis sapiens’ of
                        the Satires, and like those country neighbours whose lively talk and homely
                        wisdom Horace contrasts with the fashionable folly of Rome; and true and
                        virtuous women, such as may have suggested to the one poet the lines— </p>

                        large share of the old Italian seriousness of spirit (gravitas), which
                        distinguishes them from the other poets of their time, to the traditions of
                        virtue which the men of this class had not yet unlearned. It is remarked by
                        M. Sainte-Beuve how strong the attachment of such men usually is to their
                        homes and lands, inherited from their fathers or acquired and enriched by
                        their own industry. He characterises happily ‘cette médiocrité de fortune et

                        la limite, parcequ’on y a toujours présent le moment où l’on a acquis et
                        celui où l’on peut tout perdre.’ The truest human feeling expressed in the
                        Eclogues is the love which the old settlers had for their lands, and the
                        sorrow which they felt when forced to quit them. The Georgics bear witness
                        to the strong Italian passion for the soil, and the pride in the varied
                        results <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of his skill which made a life of
                        unceasing labour one of contentment and happiness to the husbandman. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As has happened in the case of other poets and men of poetic genius,
                        tradition recorded some marvellous circumstances attending his birth, which
                        were believed to have portended his future distinction. These stories may
                        have originated early in his career from the promise of genius afforded by
                        his childhood: or, like the mediaeval belief in his magical powers, they may
                        be a kind of mythological reflection of the veneration and affection with
                        which his memory was cherished. The character of these reported presages
                        implies the impression produced by the gentleness and sweetness of his
                            disposition<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>, as well as by the rapid growth and
                        development of his poetic faculty<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A more trustworthy indication of his early promise is afforded by the care
                        with which he was educated. Like Horace, he was fortunate in having parents
                        who, themselves of humble origin, considered him worthy of receiving the
                        best instruction which the world could give; and, like Horace, he repaid
                        their tender solicitude with affectionate gratitude. By his father’s care he
                        was from boyhood dedicated to the high calling which he faithfully followed
                        through all his life. At the age of twelve he was taken to Cremona, an old
                        Latin colony; and, from the lines in one of his earliest authentic poems
                        (the address to the villa of Siron)— </p>

                        accompanied him thither, as Horace’s father accompanied him to Rome for the
                        same purpose. On his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sixteenth
                        birth-day—the day on which, according to Donatus, Lucretius died—Virgil
                        assumed the ‘toga virilis,’ and about the same time went to Milan, and
                        continued there, engaged in study, till he removed to Rome in the year 53
                            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, when he was between sixteen and
                        seventeen years of age. It was in this year of his life that he is said to
                        have written the ‘Culex.’ There are many difficulties which prevent the
                        belief that Virgil is the author of the poem which has come down to us under
                        that name. But the consideration of these must be reserved for a later
                        examination of the poem. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At Rome he studied rhetoric under Epidius, who was also the teacher of the
                        young Octavianus. As the future Emperor made his first public appearance at
                        the age of twelve, by delivering the funeral oration over his grandmother
                        Julia, it may have happened that he and Virgil were pupils of Epidius at the
                        same time, and were not unknown to each other even before the meeting of ten
                        years later which decisively affected Virgil’s fortunes and determined his
                        career. The time of his arrival at Rome was of critical importance in
                        literature. The recent publication of the poem of Lucretius, the most
                        important event in Latin literature since the appearance of the Annals of
                        Ennius, must have stimulated the enthusiasm of the younger generation, among
                        whom poetry and oratory were at that time conjointly cultivated. Mr. Munro
                        has shown the influence exercised by this poem on the later style of
                        Catullus, who collected and edited his own poems about the time when Virgil
                        came to Rome, and died shortly afterwards. One or two of the minor poems
                        among the Catalepton, attributed to Virgil with more probability than the
                        Culex, are parodies or close imitations of the style of Catullus, and are
                        written in a freer and more satiric spirit than anything published by him in
                        later years. But it is a little remarkable that, while reproducing the
                        language and cadences of both these poets in his first acknowledged work,
                        Virgil never mentions the name either of Lucretius or Catullus. The poets
                        mentioned by him with admiration in the Eclogues are his living
                        contemporaries, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Varius and Cinna, Pollio
                        and Gallus. Is it on account of the Senatorian and anti-Caesarean sympathies
                        of the older poets that the poets of the new era thus separate themselves
                        abruptly from those of the previous epoch? If it was owing to the jealousy
                        of the new <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">régime</span></span> that the two great Augustan poets,
                        while paying a passing tribute to the impracticable virtue of Cato, never
                        mention the greater name or allude to the fate of Cicero, there seems to
                        have been nothing in the political action or expressed opinions of Lucretius
                        to call for a similar reticence. If, on the other hand, the boldness of his
                        attack on the strongholds of all religious belief had the effect of cutting
                        him off for a time from personal sympathy, as similar opposition to received
                        opinions had in modern times in the case of Spinosa and Shelley, it did not
                        interfere with the immediate influence exercised by his genius on the
                        thought and art of Virgil. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The most interesting of the minor poems among the Catalepton is one written
                        at the time when the young poet entered on the study of philosophy under
                        Siron the Epicurean. This poem expresses the joy felt by him in exchanging
                        the empty pretension and dull pedantry of rhetorical and grammatical studies
                        for the real enquiries of philosophy:— </p>

                        melancholy in the one, by the revolt and spiritual reaction in the other,
                        Lucretius and Virgil both show that these tenets could not secure to ‘the
                        passionate heart of the poet’ that calmness and serenity of spirit which
                        they gave to men of the stamp of Atticus, Velleius, or Torquatus. The final
                        lines of the poem express the lingering regret with which he bids a
                        temporary farewell to the Muses. These few lines, more than any other poem
                        attributed to Virgil, seem to bring him in his personal feelings nearer to
                        us. There is a touch of the graciousness of his nature, recalling the
                        cordial feeling of Catullus to all his young comrades, in the passing notice
                        of those who had shared his studies:— </p>

                        licentious in tone, the purity of Virgil’s nature reveals itself in the
                        prayer to the Muses to revisit his writings ‘pudenter et raro,’ chastely and
                        seldom. The whole poem is the sincere expression of the scholar and poet,
                        even in youth idealising the austere charm of philosophy, while feeling in
                        his heart the more powerful attraction of poetry. In the </p>

                        outbreak of the Civil War is likely to have interrupted his residence at
                        Rome, and he is next heard of living in his native district and engaged in
                        the composition of the Eclogues. He took no part in the war, nor ever served
                        as a soldier; and he seems to have appeared only once in the other field of
                        practical distinction open to a young Roman who had received so elaborate an
                        education—that of forensic pleading. He is said to have wanted the

                        career; and he was thus fortunate in escaping all temptation to sacrifice

                        as Licinius Calvus did, between the claims of poetry and of oratory. His
                        first literary impulse was to write an historical epic on the early Roman or
                        Alban history, and to this impulse, he himself alludes in the lines of the
                        sixth Eclogue,— </p>

                        poetic treatment,—‘offensus materia,’ as the Life of Donatus expresses it;
                        and he resolutely resisted the projects often urged upon him of giving a
                        poetical account of contemporary events, in celebration of the glory of
                        Pollio, Varus, or Caesar. But it is noticeable as a proof of the persistence
                        with which his mind continued to dwell on ideas once projected, till they
                        finally assumed appropriate shape, that in the Aeneid he really combines
                        these two purposes of vivifying the ancient traditions of Rome and Alba, and
                        of glorifying the great results <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of his own
                        era. It is by this capacity of forecasting some great work, and dwelling on
                        the idea till it clears itself of all alien matter and assimilates to itself
                        the impressions and interests of a life-time, that the vastest and most
                        enduring monuments of genius are produced. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the year of the battle of Philippi, Virgil was living in his native
                        district, engaged in the composition of his pastoral poems. Of his mode of
                        life, taste, and feelings about this time we perceive only that he continued
                        to be a student of the Alexandrine literature, that he had, by natural gift
                        and assiduous culture, brought the technical part of his art—the diction
                        and rhythm of poetry—to the highest perfection hitherto attained, that he
                        enjoyed the favour and patronage of the Governor of the province, Asinius
                        Pollio, and that he was united by strong ties of affection and warm
                        admiration to Cornelius Gallus, who, while still in early youth, had
                        obtained high distinction in poetry and a prominent position in public life.
                        There are in the Eclogues notices of other poets of the district, whose
                        friendship he enjoyed or whose jealousy he excited. The Mopsus of the fifth
                        is said to be the didactic poet, Aemilius Macer. The mention of Bavius and
                        Maevius, the ‘iurgia Codri,’ and the allusion in a later poem to Anser the
                        panegyrist of Antony, are the nearest approaches to anything like resentment
                        or personal satire that Virgil has shown. It may be that in the lines where
                        Amaryllis and Galatea and other personages of the poems are introduced he
                        refers to some personal experiences; but as compared with all the poets of
                        this era, Virgil either observed a great reticence, or enjoyed an
                        exceptional immunity from the passions of youth. The whole tone of the
                        earlier poems, and numerous expressions in all of them, such as ‘tu, Tityre,
                        lentus in umbra,’ are suggestive of a somewhat indolent enjoyment of the
                        charm of books, of poetry, and of the softer beauties of Nature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The following year was the turning-point in his career, and gave a more
                        definite aim to his genius and sympathies. In that year his own fortunes
                        became involved in the affairs which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were
                        determining the fate of the world. The Triumvirs, in assigning grants of
                        land to their soldiers, had confiscated the territory of Cremona, which had
                        shown sympathy with the Senatorian cause, and when this proved insufficient,
                        an addition was made from the adjoining Mantuan territory, in which the farm
                        of Virgil’s father was situated. The Commissioners appointed to distribute
                        the land were Pollio, Varus, and Gallus, all friendly to Virgil, and by
                        their advice he went to Rome, and obtained the restitution of his land by
                        personal application to Octavianus. On his return to his native district he
                        found that Varus had succeeded Pollio as Governor of the province. He
                        appears to have been unfriendly to the Mantuans, and was either unable or
                        unwilling to protect Virgil, who was forced at the imminent peril of his
                        life to escape, by swimming the river, from the violence of the soldier who
                        had entered on the possession of the land. Two of the Eclogues, the first
                        and the ninth, are written in connexion with these events. Though he still
                        adheres to an indirect and allusive treatment of his subject, these poems
                        possess the interest of being based on real experience. They give expression
                        to the sense of disorder, insecurity, and distress, which we learn from
                        other sources accompanied these forced divisions and alienations of land.
                        The first expresses also the gratitude of the poet to ‘the god-like youth’
                        to whom he owed the exceptional indulgence of being, though only for a short
                        time, reinstated in the possession of his land. It is characteristic either
                        of some weakness in Virgil’s nature, or of a great depression among the
                        peaceful inhabitants of Italy, that he had no thought of resisting violence
                        by violence, that he does not even express resentment against the intruder,
                        but only a feeling of wonder that any man could be capable of such
                        wickedness. To most readers the vehemence with which the author of the
                        ‘Dirae,’ under similar circumstances, curses the land and its new owners,
                        appears, if less sweet and musical, more natural than this mild submission
                        to superior force expressed by Virgil. But in these personal experiences
                        that strong sympathy with the national fortunes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which henceforward animates his poetry, originates. Virgil
                        may thus in a sense be numbered among the poets who ‘are cradled into poetry
                        by wrong.’ </p>

                        along with his family, in a small country-house which had belonged to his

                        with him, ‘those with me whom I have ever loved,’ and especially for his
                        father. His own experience at this time may have suggested to him the
                        feelings which he afterwards reproduced in describing the flight of Aeneas
                        from the ruins of Troy. </p>

                        10,000,000 sesterces (about £90,000); he possessed a house on the Esquiline
                        near the gardens of Maecenas, a villa at Naples, and a country-house near
                        Nola in Campania; and he seems to have lived from time to time in Sicily and

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For a short time afterwards Virgil lived chiefly at Rome, as one of the
                        circle of which Maecenas was the centre, consisting of those poets and men
                        eminent in the State whom Horace (Sat i. 10) mentions as the critics and
                        friends whose approval he valued. Our knowledge of Virgil at this time is
                        derived from the first Book of the Satires of Horace. It was by Virgil and
                        Varius that Horace himself was introduced to Maecenas. They were all three
                        of the party who made the famous journey to Brundisium in 37 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> While Horace starts alone from Rome, Virgil
                        and Varius join him at Sinuessa. Virgil may already have begun to withdraw
                        from habitual residence in Rome to his retirement in Campania, where he
                        principally lived from this time till his death. One line in this Satire
                        confirms the account of the weakness of his health which is given by his
                        biographer,—the line, namely, in which Horace describes himself and Virgil
                        as going to sleep, while Maecenas went to enjoy the exercise of the
                        ‘pila’:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There is no notice of Virgil in the second Book of the Satires, written
                        between the years 35 and 30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, at which time he
                        had withdrawn altogether from Rome, and was living at Naples, engaged in the
                        composition of the Georgics. Two of the Odes of Book I., however, the third
                        and the twenty-fourth, throw some light on his circumstances and character,
                        and on the relations of friendship subsisting between him and Horace. There
                        is some difficulty in determining the occasion that gave <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rise to the first of these Odes. It is addressed
                        to the ship which was to bear Virgil to Attica. As we only know of one
                        voyage of Virgil to Attica, that immediately preceding his death, and as the
                        first three Books of the Odes were originally published some years before
                        that date, we must suppose either that this Ode refers to an earlier voyage
                        contemplated or actually accomplished by Virgil; or that the Virgil here
                        spoken of is a different person; or that the publication of the edition of
                        the Odes which we possess was of a later date than that generally accepted.
                        The reason for rejecting the second of these alternatives has been already
                        given. Two reasons may be given for rejecting the third,—first, the
                        improbability that one of the latest, if not the latest, in point of time
                        among all the Odes in the three Books should be placed third in order in the
                        first Book, among Odes that all refer to a much earlier period; and
                        secondly, that this Ode, in respect of the somewhat conventional nature of
                        the thought and the character of the mythological allusions, is clearly
                        written in Horace’s earlier manner. There is no improbability in accepting
                        the first alternative, that as Virgil travelled to and resided in Sicily, so
                        he may have made, or at least contemplated, an earlier voyage to Greece. One
                        object for such a voyage may have been the desire of seeing the localities
                        which he represents Aeneas as passing or visiting in the course of his
                        adventures between the time of leaving Troy and settling in Latium. The
                        Aeneid indicates in many places the tastes of a cultivated traveller; and
                        parts of the sea-voyage of Aeneas look as if they were founded on personal
                        reminiscences. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It may be noticed in several of the Odes of Horace how he adapts the vein of
                        thought running through them to the character or position of the person to
                        whom they refer. The revival of the old Hesiodic and theological idea of the
                        sin and impiety of that spirit of enterprise which led men first to brave
                        the dangers of the sea, and to baffle the purpose of the Deity in separating

                        their common friend Quintilius Varus, probably the Varus of the tenth poem
                        of Catullus, and thus one of the last survivors of the friendly circle of
                        poets and wits of a former generation. While a high tribute to the pure
                        character of their lost friend, it is at the same time a tribute to the
                        pious and affectionate character of Virgil. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is a delicate touch of appreciation that Horace dwells more on the
                        thought of the depth of Virgil’s sorrow for their common friend than on his
                        own. Both of these Odes give evidence of the strong affection which Virgil
                        inspired; the second affords further evidence of the qualities in virtue of
                        which he inspired that feeling. Similar proof of affection and appreciation
                        is afforded by the words in which Horace in the fifth Satire of Book I.
                        characterises Virgil (‘Vergilius optimus,’ as he elsewhere calls him), and

                        task which he had imposed on himself. So early as the year 26 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, Augustus while engaged in the Cantabrian
                        war, had desired to see some part of the poem. It was in answer to that
                        request that Virgil wrote the letter of which the fragment, quoted in the
                        previous chapter, has been preserved by Macrobius<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>. At a later time, after the death of the young
                        Marcellus (23 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>), he read three Books to
                        Augustus and the other members of his family. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After spending eleven years on the composition of his great epic, he set
                        aside three more for its final correction. In the year 19 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> he set out with the view of travelling in
                        Greece and Asia. Meeting Augustus at Athens, he was persuaded to abandon his
                        purpose and return with him to Italy. While visiting Megara under a burning
                        sun he was seized with illness. Continuing his voyage without interruption,
                        he became worse, and on the 21st of September, a few days after landing at
                        Brundisium, he died in the fifty-first year of his age. In his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>last illness he showed the ruling passion of his
                        life—the craving perfection—by calling for the cases which held his MSS.,
                        with the intention of burning the Aeneid. It is in keeping with the absence
                        of self-assertion in his writings that his final hours were clouded by this
                        sad sense of failure, rather than brightened by such confident assurances of
                        immortality as other Roman poets have expressed. In the same spirit of
                        dissatisfaction with all imperfect accomplishment, he left directions in his
                        will that his executors, Varius and Tucca, should publish nothing but what
                        had been already edited by him. This direction, which would have deprived
                        the world of the Aeneid, was disregarded by them in compliance with the
                        commands of Augustus. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The interest of the life of Virgil lies in the bearing of his circumstances
                        on the development of his genius, in the view which it affords of his whole
                        nature as a man, and in the relation of that nature to the work accomplished
                        by him as a poet. The biography of Horace has an independent value as
                        affording insight into social life and character, irrespective of the light
                        which it reflects on the art of the poet. But no separate line of action,
                        adventure, or enjoyment runs through and intermingles with the even course
                        of Virgil’s poetic career. And this may have been a drawback to him as the
                        poet of political action, of heroic adventure, and of human character. His
                        career in this respect is unlike that of other great poets who have been
                        endowed with the epic or dramatic faculty, who either took part in the
                        serious action of their age, or gave proof in their lives of some share of
                        the adventurous spirit or of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rich
                        social nature which they have delineated in their works. In the same way the
                        life of Livy was that merely of a man of letters, and thus different from
                        that of the other great historians of antiquity, who had either passed
                        through a career of adventure, like Herodotus and Xenophon, or had been
                        actively engaged in public affairs, like Thucydides and Polybius, Sallust
                        and Tacitus. The ‘inscitia Reipublicae ut alienae’ thus betrays itself in
                        Livy more than in any of those historians who have been named. Virgil’s life
                        was as much one of pure contemplation or absorption in his art, as that of
                        Lucretius or Wordsworth. The first half of his career, from childhood to
                        maturity, was an education, passive and active, for the position he was
                        destined to fill as the greatest literary artist and greatest national poet
                        of Rome. His later career, from the age of twenty-eight till his too early
                        death, was the fulfilment of the office to which he had dedicated himself.
                        With the exception of one troubled year of his early manhood, which proved
                        the turning-point of his fortunes, he lived, undistracted by business or
                        pleasure, the life of a scholar and poet, combining the concentrated
                        industry of the first with the sense of joyful activity and ever-ripening
                        faculty which sustains and cheers the second. In youth his means of living
                        must have been moderate, yet sufficient to enable him to forsake everything
                        else for his art: in later life, through the munificence of Augustus, he was
                        rich enough to enjoy exemption from the cares of life, and to gratify freely
                        the one taste by which his poetical gifts were fostered—that of living and
                        varying his residence among the fairest scenes of Southern Italy. The one
                        drawback to his happiness, viz. that he suffered during all his life from
                        delicate or variable health<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a>, was not unfavourable to the concentration of his
                        whole nature on his self-appointed task. It saved him from ever sacrificing
                        the high aim of his existence to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pleasures in which his contemporaries indulged, and to which the
                        imaginative temperament of the poets and artists of a southern land is
                        powerfully attracted. The abstemious regimen which from necessity or
                        inclination he observed, the fact recorded of him that he ‘took very little
                        food and wine,’ must have quickened the finer sources of emotion by which
                        his genius was nourished. Had he received from nature a robuster fibre and
                        more hardihood of spirit, or had his character been more tempered by
                        collision with the active forces of life, his epic poem might have shown a
                        more original energy, and greater power in delineating varied types of
                        character: but in combination with a robuster or more energetic temper, much
                        of the peculiar charm of Virgil would have been lost. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He is said to have been of a tall and awkward figure, of dark complexion,
                        and to have preserved through all his life a look of rusticity. He wanted
                        readiness in ordinary conversation, and never overcame the shyness of his
                        rustic origin or studious habits. It is reported that in his rare visits to
                        Rome he avoided observation, and took refuge in the nearest house from the
                        crowds of people who recognised or followed him. The ‘monstrari digito
                        praetereuntium’ was to him a source of embarrassment rather than of that
                        gratification which Horace derived from it. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Both his parents lived till after the loss of his farm, when the poet was in
                        his twenty-ninth year. Two brothers died before him, one while still a boy,
                        the other after reaching manhood. To his half-brother Valerius Proculus he
                        left one half of his estate. Augustus, Maecenas, and his two friends Varius
                        and Tucca also received legacies. He was never married, nor is there any
                        record in connexion with him of any of those temporary liaisons which the
                        other poets of the Augustan Age formed and celebrated in their verse. Some
                        modern critics arguing from a single expression in the Life by Donatus, and
                        giving to a tradition connected with the subject of the second Eclogue a
                        meaning which, even if the tradition was trustworthy, need not apply to it,
                        have written of Virgil as if throughout his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whole life he yielded to a laxity of morals from which perhaps some of his
                        eminent contemporaries were not free, but which was condemned by the manlier
                        instincts of Romans, as of all modern nations. The expression of Donatus is
                        probably a mere survival of the calumnies against which Asconius vindicated
                        Virgil’s character. The statement of the same biographer, that on account of
                        his purity of speech and life he was known in Naples by the name
                        ‘Parthenias,’ is at least as trustworthy evidence as that on which the
                        imputations on his character have been revived. The levity and mendacity
                        with which such calumnies were invented<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>, and the attractions which they have for the baser nature
                        of men in all times, sufficiently explain both the original existence and
                        the later revival of these imputations. We are called upon not merely to
                        disregard them as unproved, or irrelevant to our estimate of the poet’s art,
                        but to reject them as incompatible with the singular purity and transparent
                        sincerity of nature revealed in all the maturer works of his genius<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>. </p>

                        Horace confirms the impression of delicacy and simplicity of character
                        suggested by the general tone of Virgil’s writings. The appreciation of
                        Horace for Virgil reminds us of the touching tribute which the great comic
                        poet of Athens pays to her greatest tragic poet, where he speaks of him as
                        showing the same disposition among the Shades as he had shown in the world

                        contemporaries, surviving in the tradition handed on to future times,
                        testify to Virgil’s exemption from the personal frailties and asperities to
                        which the impressible and mobile temperament of genius is peculiarly liable. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His works do not present any single distinct impression of the poet himself,
                        in his own character and convictions, separable from his artistic
                        representation. Yet from the study of these works we are able to form a
                        general conception of the disposition, affections, and moral sympathies
                        which distinguish him from the other great writers of his country. We might
                        perhaps without undue fancifulness express the dominant ethical or social
                        characteristic—the ideal virtue or grace—of some of the great Roman
                        writers by some word peculiarly expressive of Roman character or culture,
                        and of frequent use in these writers themselves. Thus, in regard to Cicero,
                        the man of quick susceptibility to praise and blame, to sympathy and
                        coldness, who, except where his personal or political antagonism was roused,
                        had the liveliest sense of the claims of kind offices and kind feeling which
                        men have on one another, the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humanitas</span></span> seems to
                        sum up those qualities of heart and intellect which, in spite of the
                        transparent weaknesses of his character, gained for him so much affection,
                        and which, through the sympathy they enabled him to feel and arouse in
                        others, were the secret of his unparalleled success as an advocate. To
                        Lucretius we might apply the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sanctitas</span></span>, in the
                        sense in which he applies the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sanctus</span></span> to the old
                        philosophers, as expressive of that glow of reverential emotion which
                        animates him in his search after truth and in his contemplation of Nature.
                        His own words ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lepor</span></span>’ and ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lepidus</span></span>’ express the graceful vivacity, artistic and social rather
                        than ethical, which we associate with the thought of Catullus. The quality,
                        mainly intellectual and social, but still not devoid of ethical content, of
                        which Horace is the most perfect type, is ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">urbanitas</span></span>.’ The full meaning of the great Roman word ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gravitas</span></span>’—the vital force of ethical feeling as well
                        as the strength of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>character connoted by
                        it, and by its sister-qualities ‘dignity and authority’—is only completely
                        realised in the pages of Tacitus. And so it is only in Virgil, and
                        especially in that poem in which he deals with types of human character and
                        motives originating in human affection, that we understand all the feelings
                        of love to family and country, and of fidelity to the dead, and that sense
                        of dependence on a higher Power, sanctioning and sanctifying these feelings
                        and the duties demanded by them, which the Romans comprehended in their use
                        of the word ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pietas</span></span>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With this recognition of man’s dependence on a wise and beneficent Power
                        above him, is perhaps connected another moral characteristic strongly
                        indicated in many passages of the Aeneid, and mentioned among the personal
                        attributes of Virgil in some of the editions of Donatus’s Life, though it
                        does not appear in that accepted by the latest critics as resting on the
                        best MS. authority<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>. This
                        quality is the stoical power of endurance which he attributes to his hero,
                        but which in him is combined with nothing either of the austerity or
                        pedantry of Stoicism. The passage in the biography, which, if an
                        interpolation in the original Life, is one that is at least ‘well invented,’
                        is to the following effect:—‘He was in the habit of saying that there was
                        no virtue of more use to a man than patience, and that there was no fortune
                        so harsh, that a brave man cannot triumph over it by wisely enduring it.’
                        Mr. Wickham, in his edition of Horace, refers to this passage as
                        illustrating the maxims of consolation addressed by Horace to Virgil on the
                        death of their friend Quintilius. Many lines in the Aeneid, such as the </p>

                        Roman fortitude and resolute endurance. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The reproach from which it is impossible entirely to clear his memory is
                        that of undue subservience to power. It was in the qualities of independence
                        and self-assertion that his character was deficient. It is to the excess of
                        his feeling of deference to power, and not to any insincerity of nature,
                        that we attribute the language occasionally—as in the Invocation to the
                        Georgics—transcending the limits of truth and sobriety, in which the
                        position of Augustus is magnified. It is for ever to be regretted that he
                        was induced to sacrifice not only the tribute of admiration originally
                        offered to the friend of his youth, but even the symmetrical conception of
                        his greatest poem, to the jealousy which Augustus entertained of the memory
                        of Gallus. Virgil, again, has no sympathy with political life, as it
                        realised itself in the ancient republics, or with the energetic types of
                        character which the conflicts of political life develope. His own somewhat
                        submissive disposition, his personal attachments and admirations, his hatred
                        of strife, his yearning after peace and reconcilement, made him a sincere
                        supporter of the idea of the Empire in opposition to that of the Republic.
                        To a character of a more combative energy and power of resistance it would
                        have been scarcely possible to have been unmoved by the spectacle of the
                        final overthrow of ancient freedom, though that freedom had for a long time
                        previously contributed little to human happiness. But the nobleness of
                        Virgil’s nature is not the nobleness of those qualities which make men great
                        in resistance to wrong, but the nobleness of a gentle and gracious spirit. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By no poet in any time has he been surpassed in devotion to his art. Into
                        this channel all the currents of his being, all fresh sources of feeling,
                        all the streams of his meditation and research were poured. The delight in
                        poetry and the kindred delight in the beauty of Nature were the main springs
                        of his happiness. With the high ambition of genius and the unceasing aim at
                        perfection he combined a remarkable modesty and a generous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>appreciation of all poets who had gone before him.
                        But distrust in himself never led to any flagging of energy. The stories
                        told of his habits of composition confirm the impression of his assiduous
                        industry. In writing the Georgics he is said to have dictated many lines
                        early in the morning, under the first impulse of his inspiration, and to
                        have employed the remainder of the day in concentrating their force within
                        the smallest compass. Of no poem of equal length can it be said that there
                        is so little that is superfluous. He himself described this mode of
                        composition by the phrase ‘parere se versus modo atque ritu ursino’—‘that
                        he produced verses by licking them into shape as a bear did with her cubs.’
                        The Aeneid was first arranged and written out in prose: when the structure
                        of the story was distinct to his mind, he proceeded to work on different
                        parts of it, as his fancy moved him. Another statement in regard to his
                        manner of reading is worth mentioning, as indicating the powerful
                        inspiration of the true <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">ἀοιδός</span></span>, which he added to the patient
                        industry of the conscientious artist. It is recorded on the authority of a
                        contemporary poet, that he read his own poems with such a wonderful
                        sweetness and charm (‘suavitate tum lenociniis miris’), that verses which
                        would have sounded commonplace when read by another, produced a marvellous
                        effect when ‘chanted to their own music<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>’ by the poet himself. Similar testimony is given of the
                        effect produced by the reading or recitation of their own works by some
                        among our own poets, Wordsworth, Scott, and Byron among others. This large,
                        musical, and impassioned utterance—the ‘os magna sonaturum’—is a sure note
                        of that access of emotion which forces the poet to find a rhythmical
                        expression for his thought. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was through the union of a strong and delicate vein of original genius
                        with a great receptive capacity and an unwearied love of his art that Virgil

                        be fully re-established, the examination of his various works will show that
                        it was not through accident or caprice that one of the highest places in the
                        dynasty of genius was allotted to him, and that his still remains one of the

                        us nothing of the subject of which it treats. The word ‘Eclogae’ simply
                        means selections. As applied to the poems of Virgil, it designates a
                        collection of short unconnected poems. The other name by which these poems
                        were known in antiquity, ‘bucolica,’ indicates the form of Greek art in
                        which they were cast and the pastoral nature of their subjects. Neither word
                        is used by Virgil himself; but the expressions by which he characterises his
                        art, such as ‘Sicelides Musae,’ ‘versus Syracosius,’ ‘Musa agrestis’ and
                        ‘silvestris,’ show that he writes in a pastoral strain, and that he
                        considered the pastoral poetry of Greece as his model. He invokes not only
                        the ‘Sicilian Muses,’ but the ‘fountain of Arethusa.’ He speaks too of Pan,
                        and Arcadia, and the ‘Song of Maenalus.’ His shepherd-poets are described as
                        ‘Arcadians.’ The poets whom he introduces as his prototypes are the ‘sage of
                        Ascra,’ and the mythical Linus, Orpheus, and Amphion. He alludes also to
                        Theocritus under the name of the ‘Syracusan shepherd.’ The names of the
                        shepherds who are introduced as contending in song or uttering their
                        feelings in monologue—Corydon, Thyrsis, Menalcas, Meliboeus, Tityrus,
                        etc.—are Greek, and for the most part taken from the pastoral idyls of
                        Theocritus. There is also frequent mention of the shepherd’s pipe, and of
                        the musical accompaniment to which some of the songs chanted by the
                        shepherds are set. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The general character of the poems is further indicated by the frequent use
                        of the word ‘ludere,’ a word applied by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Catullus, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, and others to the poems of youth, of a
                        light and playful character, and, for the most part, expressive of various
                        moods of the passion of love. Thus at the end of the Georgics Virgil speaks
                        of himself thus:— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This reference shows further that the poem which stands first in order was
                        placed there when the edition of the Eclogues was given to the world. But
                        other references (at v. 86–87 and vi. 12) seem to imply that the separate
                        poems were known either by distinct titles, such as Varus, the title of the
                        sixth, or from their opening lines, as the ‘Formosum Corydon ardebat
                        Alexim,’ and the ‘Cuium pecus? an Meliboei?’ It has been also suggested,
                        from lines quoted in the ninth, which profess to be the opening lines of
                        other pastoral poems, that the ten finally collected together were actual
                        ‘selections’ from a larger number, commenced if not completed (‘necdum
                        perfecta canebat’) by Virgil. But these passages seem more like the lines
                        attributed to the contending poets in the third and seventh Eclogues, i.e.
                        short unconnected specimens of pastoral song. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nearly all the poems afford indications of the time of their composition and
                        of the order in which they followed one another; and that order is different
                        from the order in which they now appear. It is said, on the authority of
                        Asconius, that three years, from 42 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> to 39 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, were given to the composition of the
                        Eclogues. But an allusion in the tenth (line 47) to the expedition of
                        Agrippa across the Alps in the early part of 37 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> proves that a later date must be assigned to that poem. The
                        probable explanation is that Virgil had intended to end the series with the
                        eighth, which celebrated the triumph of Pollio over the Parthini in 39 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> but that his friendship for Gallus induced him to add the tenth, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>two years later, either before the poems were
                        finally collected for publication, or in preparing a new edition of them.
                        They were written at various places and at various stages of the poet’s
                        fortunes. They appear to have obtained great success when first published,
                        and some of them were recited with applause upon the stage. The earliest in
                        point of time were the second and third, and these, along with the fifth,
                        may be ascribed to the year 42 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> The seventh,
                        which has no allusion to contemporary events and is a mere imitative
                        reproduction of the Greek idyl, may also belong to this earlier period,
                        although some editors rank it as one of the latest. The first, which is
                        founded on the loss of the poet’s farm, belongs to the next year, and the
                        ninth and sixth probably may be assigned to the same year, or to the early
                        part of the following year. The date of the fourth is fixed by the
                        Consulship of Pollio to the year 40 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>; that of
                        the eighth to the year 39 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> by the triumph of
                        Pollio over the Parthini. The opening words of the tenth show that it was
                        the last of the series; and the reference to the expedition of Agrippa
                        implies that it could not have been written earlier than the end of 38 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> or the beginning of 37 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> The first, second, third, and fifth<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>, were in all probability written by the poet in his native
                        district, the sixth, ninth, and perhaps the seventh, at the villa which had
                        formerly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>belonged to Siron (‘villula quae
                        Sironis <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eras</span></span>’), the rest at Rome. The principle on
                        which the poems are arranged seems to be that of alternating dialogue with
                        monologue. The eighth, though not in dialogue, yet resembles the latter part
                        of the fifth, in presenting two continuous songs, chanted by different
                        shepherds. The poem first in order may have occupied its place from its
                        greater interest in connexion with the poet’s fortunes, or from the honour
                        which it assigns to Octavianus, whose pre-eminence over the other
                        competitors for supreme power had sufficiently declared itself before the
                        first collected edition of the poems was published. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the earliest poems of the series the art of Virgil, like the lyrical art
                        of Horace in his earlier Odes, is more imitative and conventional than in
                        those written later. He seems satisfied with reproducing the form, rhythm,
                        and diction of Theocritus, and mingling some vague expression of personal or
                        national feeling with the sentiment of the Greek idyl. That the fifth was
                        written after the second and third appears from the lines v. 86–87, in which
                        Menalcas, under which name Virgil introduces himself in the Eclogues,
                        presents his pipe to Mopsus:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> From these lines also it may be inferred as probable that the second poem,
                        ‘Formosum pastor Corydon,’ was written before the third, ‘Dic mihi, Damoeta,
                        cuium pecus? an Meliboei?’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A tradition, quoted by Servius and referred to (though inaccurately) by
                            Martial<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a>, attributes the
                        composition of the second Eclogue to the admiration excited in Virgil by the
                        beauty of a young slave, Alexander, who was presented to him by Pollio and
                        carefully educated by him. A similar story is told of his having received
                        from Maecenas another slave, named Cebes, who also obtained from him a
                        liberal education <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and acquired some
                        distinction as a poet. It is not improbable that Virgil may have been warmly
                        attached to these youths, and that there was nothing blameable in his
                        attachment. Even Cicero, a man as far removed as possible from any
                        sentimental weakness, writes to Atticus of the death of a favourite slave, a
                        young Greek, and evidently, from the position he filled in Cicero’s
                        household, a boy of liberal accomplishments, in these words: ‘And, I assure
                        you, I am a good deal distressed. For my reader, Sositheus, a charming boy,
                        is just dead; and it has affected me more than I should have thought the
                        death of a slave ought to affect one<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a>.’ It remains true however that in one or two of those Eclogues in
                        which he most closely imitates Theocritus, Virgil uses the language of
                        serious sentiment, and once of bantering raillery, in a way which justly
                        offends modern feeling. And this is all that can be said against him. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There are more imitations of the Greek in this and in the next poem than in
                        any of the other Eclogues<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>. The scenery of
                        the piece, in so far as it is at all definite, combines the mountains and
                        the sea-landscape of Sicily with Italian woods and vineyards. Corydon seems
                        to combine the features of an Italian vinedresser with the conventional
                        character of a Sicilian shepherd. The line </p>

                        and this reference to ploughing seems inconsistent with the description of
                        the fierce midsummer heat, and with the introduction of the ‘fessi messores’
                        in the opening lines of the poem. These inconsistencies show how little
                        thought Virgil had for the objective consistency of his representation. The
                        poem however, in many places, gives powerful expression to the feelings of a
                        despairing lover. There are here, as in the Gallus, besides that vein of
                        feeling which the Latin poet shares with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Theocritus, some traces of that ‘wayward modern mood’ of longing to escape
                        from the world and to return to some vague ideal of Nature, and to sacrifice
                        all the gains of civilisation in exchange for the homeliest dwelling shared

                        Greek idyl, the natural banter of the shepherds and the more artificial
                        contest in song, is still more imitative and composite in character. It
                        shows several close imitations, especially of the fourth, fifth, and eighth
                        Idyls of Theocritus<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>. In this poem only Virgil, whose muse
                        even in the Eclogues is almost always serious or plaintive, endeavours to
                        reproduce the playfulness and vivacity of his original. Both in the
                        bantering dialogue and in the more formal contest of the shepherds, the
                        subjects introduced are for the most part of a conventional pastoral

                        lines 10–11 there is, as in Eclogue ii., an apparent blending of the
                        occupations of the Italian vinedresser with those of the Sicilian shepherd.
                        In the contest of song there is no sustained connexion of thought, as indeed
                        there is not in similar contests in Theocritus. These contests are supposed
                        to reproduce the utterances of improvisatori, of whom the second speaker is
                        called to say something, either in continuation of or in contrast to the
                        thought of the first. The shepherds in these strains seek to glorify their
                        own prowess, boast of their successes in love, or call attention to some
                        picturesque aspect of their rustic life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fifth Eclogue is also in dialogue. It brings before us a friendly
                        interchange of song between two pastoral poets, Mopsus and Menalcas. Servius
                        mentions that Menalcas (here, as in the ninth Eclogue) stands for Virgil
                        himself, while Mopsus stands for his friend Aemilius Macer of Verona. Mopsus
                        laments the cruel death of Daphnis, the legendary shepherd of Sicilian song,
                        and Menalcas celebrates his apotheosis. Various accounts were given in
                        antiquity of the meaning which was to be attached to this poem. One account
                        was that Virgil here expressed his sorrow for the death of his brother
                            Flaccus<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>. Though
                        the time of his death may have coincided with that of the composition of
                        this poem, the language of the lament and of the song celebrating the ascent
                        of Daphnis to heaven is quite unlike the expression of a private or personal
                        sorrow. There seems no reason to doubt another explanation which has come

                        this pastoral allegory Virgil laments the death and proclaims the apotheosis
                        of Julius Caesar. It is probable<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> that the poem was composed for his
                        birthday, the 4th of July, which for the first time was celebrated with
                        religious rites in the year 42 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, when the

                        which is listened to also by the poet himself, who here calls himself

                        shattered themselves against the forces of the new Empire. There is a
                        strange contrast between these peaceful and somewhat unreal strains of

                        human affairs. No sound of the ‘storms that raged outside his happy ground’
                        disturbs the security with which Virgil cultivates his art. But the
                        following year brought the trouble and unhappiness of the times home to the
                        peaceful dwellers around Mantua, and to Virgil among the rest. Of the misery
                        caused by the confiscations and allotments of land to the soldiers of
                        Octavianus, the first Eclogue is a lasting record. Yet even in this poem,
                        based as it is on genuine feeling and a real experience, Virgil seems to
                        care only for the truth of feeling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with
                        which Tityrus and Meliboeus express themselves, without regard for
                        consistency in the conception of the situation, the scenery, or the
                        personages of the poem. Tityrus is at once the slave who goes to Rome to
                        purchase his freedom, and the owner of the land and of the flocks and herds
                        belonging to it<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>.

                        afternoon? </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sixth Eclogue was written probably about the same time and at the same
                        place, the villa of Siron, in which Virgil had taken refuge with his family.
                        It is inscribed with the name of Varus, who is said to have been a
                        fellow-student of Virgil under the tuition of Siron. But, with the exception
                        of the dedicatory lines, there is no reference to the circumstances of the
                        time. Though abounding with rich pastoral illustrations, the poem is rather
                        a mythological and semi-philosophical idyl than a pure pastoral poem. It
                        consists mainly of a song of Silenus, in which an account is given of the
                        creation of the world in accordance with the Lucretian philosophy; and, in
                        connexion with this theme (as is done also by Ovid in his Metamorphoses),
                        some of the oldest mythological traditions, such as the tale of Pyrrha and
                        Deucalion, the reign of Saturn on earth, the theft and punishment of
                        Prometheus, etc., are introduced. The opening <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lines—Namque canebat uti—are imitated from the song of
                        Orpheus in the first book of the Argonautics<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>, but they bear unmistakable traces also of the study of
                        Lucretius. There seems no trace of the language of Theocritus in the poem. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Three points of interest may be noted in this song: (1) Virgil here, as in
                        Georgic ii. 475, etc., regards the revelation of physical knowledge as a
                        fitting theme for poetic treatment. So in the first Aeneid, the ‘Song of
                        Iopas’ is said to be about ‘the wandering moon and the toils of the sun; the
                        origin of man and beast, water and fire,’ etc. The revelation of the secrets
                        of Nature seems to float before the imagination of Virgil as the highest
                        consummation of his poetic faculty. (2) We note here how, as afterwards in
                        the Georgics, he accepts the philosophical ideas of creation, side by side
                        with the supernatural tales of mythology. He seems to regard such tales as
                        those here introduced as part of the religious traditions of the human race,
                        and as a link which connects man with the gods. In the Georgics we find also
                        the same effort to reconcile, or at least to combine, the conceptions of
                        science with mythological fancies. In this effort we recognise the influence
                        of other Alexandrine poets rather than of Theocritus. (3) The introduction
                        of Gallus in the midst of the mythological figures of the poem, and the
                        account of the honour paid to him by the Muses and of the office assigned to
                        him by Linus, are characteristic of the art of the Eclogues, which is not so
                        much allegorical as composite. It brings together in the same representation
                        facts, personages, and places from actual life and the figures and scenes of
                        a kind of fairy-land. In the tenth Eclogue Gallus is thus identified with
                        the Daphnis of Sicilian song, and is represented as the object of care to
                        the Naiads and Pan and Apollo. While Pollio is the patron whose protection
                        and encouragement Virgil most cordially acknowledges in his earlier poems,
                        Gallus is the man among his contemporaries who has most powerfully touched
                        his imagination and gained his affections. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Eclogue composed next in order of time is the ‘Pollio.’ It was written
                        in the consulship of Pollio, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> 40, immediately
                        after the reconciliation between Antony and Octavianus effected by the
                        treaty of Brundisium, and gives expression to that vague hope of a new era
                        of peace and prosperity which recurs so often in the poetry of this age. In
                        consequence of the interpretation given to it in a later age, this poem has
                        acquired an importance connected with Virgil’s religious belief second only
                        to the importance of the sixth Aeneid. Early Christian writers, perceiving a
                        parallel between expressions and ideas in this poem and those in the
                        Messianic prophecies, believed that Virgil was here the unconscious vehicle
                        of Divine inspiration, and that he prophesies of the new era which was to
                        begin with the birth of Christ. And though, as Conington and others have
                        pointed out, the picture of the Golden Age given in the poem is drawn
                        immediately from Classical and not from Hebrew sources, yet there is no
                        parallel in Classical poetry to that which is the leading idea of the poem,
                        the coincidence of the commencement of this new era with the birth of a
                        child whom a marvellous career awaited. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The poem begins with an invocation to the Sicilian Muses and with the
                        declaration that, though the strain is still pastoral, yet it is to be in a
                        higher mood, and worthy of the Consul to whom it is addressed. Then follows
                        the announcement of the birth of a new era. The world after passing through
                        a cycle of ages, each presided over by a special deity, had reached the last
                        of the cycle, presided over by Apollo, and was about to return back to the
                        Golden or Saturnian Age of peace and innocence, into which the human race
                        was originally born. A new race of men was to spring from heaven. The
                        first-born of this new stock was destined hereafter to be a partaker of the
                        life of the gods and to ‘rule over a world in peace with the virtues of his
                        father.’ Then follow the rural and pastoral images of the Golden Age, like
                        those given in the first Georgic in the description of the early world
                        before the reign of Jove. The full glory of the age should not be reached
                        till this child <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>should attain the maturity
                        of manhood. In the meantime some traces of ‘man’s original sin’ (‘priscae
                        vestigia fraudis’) should still urge him to brave the dangers of the sea, to
                        surround his cities with walls, and to plough the earth into furrows. There
                        should be a second expedition of the Argonauts, and a new Achilles should be
                        sent against another Troy. The romantic adventures of the heroic age were to
                        precede the rest, innocence, and spontaneous abundance of the age of Saturn.
                        Next the child is called upon to prepare himself for the ‘magni
                        honores’—the great offices of state which awaited him; and the poet prays
                        that his own life and inspiration may be prolonged so far as to enable him
                        to celebrate his career. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There seem to be no traces of imitation of Theocritus in this poem. The
                        rhythm which in the other Eclogues reproduces the Theocritean cadences is in
                        this more stately and uniform, recalling those of Catullus in his longest
                        poem. The substance of the poem is quite unlike anything in the Sicilian
                        idyl. Though this substance does not stand out in the clear light of
                        reality, but is partially revealed through a haze of pastoral images and
                        legendary associations, yet it is not altogether unmeaning. The anticipation
                        of a new era was widely spread and vividly felt over the world; and this
                        anticipation—the state of men’s minds at and subsequent to the time when
                        this poem was written—probably contributed to the acceptance of the great
                        political and spiritual changes which awaited the world<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Two questions which have been much discussed in connexion with this poem
                        remain to be noticed; (1) who is the child <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>born in the consulship of Pollio of whom this marvellous career is
                        predicted? (2) is it at all probable that Virgil, directly or indirectly,
                        had any knowledge of the Messianic prophecies or ideas? </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In answer to the first we may put aside at once the supposition that the
                        prediction is made of the child who was born in that year to Octavianus and
                        Scribonia. The words ‘nascenti puero’ are altogether inapplicable to the
                        notorious and unfortunate Julia, who was the child of that marriage. If
                        Virgil was sanguine enough to predict the sex of the child, we can hardly
                        imagine him allowing the words to stand after his prediction had been
                        falsified. We may equally dismiss the supposition that the child spoken of
                        was the offspring of the marriage of Antony and Octavia. Not to mention
                        other considerations adverse to this supposition<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a>, it would have been impossible for Virgil, the
                        devoted partisan of Caesar, to pay this special compliment to Antony, even
                        after he became so closely connected with his rival. There remains a third
                        supposition, that the child spoken of is the son of Pollio, Asinius Gallus,
                        who plays an important part in the reign of Tiberius. This last
                        interpretation is supported by the authority of Asconius, who professed to
                        have heard it from Asinius Gallus himself. The objection to this
                        interpretation is that Virgil was not likely to assign to the child of one
                        who, as compared with Octavianus and Antony, was only a secondary personage
                        in public affairs, the position of ‘future ruler of the world’ and the
                        function of being ‘the regenerator of his age.’ Still less could a poem
                        bearing this meaning have been allowed to retain its place among Virgil’s
                        works after the ascendency of Augustus became undisputed. Further, the line </p>

                        to the actual son of a mortal father and mother. These difficulties have led
                        some interpreters to suppose that the child spoken of is an ideal or
                        imaginary representative of the future race. But if we look more closely at
                        the poem, we find that the child is not really spoken of as the future
                        regenerator of the age; he is merely the first-born of the new race, which
                        was to be nearer to the gods both in origin and in actual communion with
                        them. Again, the words </p>

                        as they would ten or twenty years later. At the time when the poem was
                        written the consulship was still the highest recognised position in the
                        State. The Consuls for the year, nominally at least, wielded the whole power
                        of the Empire. The words ‘reget orbem’ remain as a token that the Republic
                        was not yet entirely extinct. The child is called upon to prepare himself
                        for the great offices of State in the hope that he should in time hold the
                        high place which was now held by his father. The words ‘patriis virtutibus’
                        imply that he is no ideal being, but the actual son of a well-known father.
                        Virgil takes occasion in this poem to commemorate the attainment of the
                        highest office by his patron, to celebrate the birth of the son born in the
                        year of his consulship, and at the same time to express, by mystical and
                        obscure allusions, the trust that the peace of Brundisium was the
                        inauguration of that new era for which the hearts of men all over the world
                        were longing. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In turning to the second question, discussed in connexion with this Eclogue,
                        the great amount and recondite character of Virgil’s learning, especially of
                        that derived from Alexandrine sources, must be kept in view. Macrobius
                        testifies to this in several places. Thus he writes, ‘for this poet was
                        learned with not only a minute conscientiousness, but even with a kind of
                        reserve and mystery, so that he introduced into his works much <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>knowledge the sources of which are difficult to
                            discover<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a>.’ In another
                        place he speaks of those things, ‘what he had introduced from the most
                        recondite learning of the Greeks<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a>.’ And again he says,
                        ‘this story Virgil has dug out from the most recondite Greek literature<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>.’ It is indeed most improbable that Virgil had a
                        direct knowledge of the Septuagint. If he had this knowledge it would have
                        shown itself by other allusions in other parts of his works. But it is quite
                        possible that, through other channels of Alexandrine learning, the ideas and
                        the language of Hebrew prophecy may have become indirectly known to him. One
                        channel by which this may have reached him would be the new Sibylline
                        prophecies, manufactured in the East and probably reflecting Jewish as well
                        as other Oriental ideas, which poured into Rome after the old Sibylline
                        books had perished in the burning of the Capitol during the first Civil War. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still, admitting these possibilities, we are not called upon to go beyond
                        classical sources for the general substance and idea of this poem. It has
                        more in common with the myth in the Politicus of Plato than with the
                        Prophecies of Isaiah. The state of the world at the time when the poem was
                        written produced the longing for an era of restoration and a return to a
                        lost ideal of innocence and happiness, and the wish became father to the
                        thought. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> testify to the personal influence under which Virgil wrote these poems. The
                        title of ‘Pharmaceutria,’ by which the poem is known, indicates that Virgil
                        professes to reproduce, in an Italian form, that passionate tale of city
                        life which forms the object of the second idyl of Theocritus. But while the
                        subject and burden of the second of the two songs contained in this Eclogue
                        are suggested by that idyl, the poem is very far from being a mere imitative

                        the orchards and rich cultivated land of Italy, instead of the free life and
                        natural beauties of the Sicilian mountains. The descriptive touches
                        suggesting the picture of the innocent romance of boyhood are also all
                        Virgil’s own. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The song of Alphesiboeus represents a wife endeavouring to recall her
                        truant, though still faithful, Daphnis from the city to his home. Though
                        some of the illustrations in this song also are Greek, yet it contains
                        several natural references to rustic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>superstitions which were probably common to Greek and Italian peasants;
                        and the fine simile at line 85 (of which the first hint is to be found in
                            Lucretius<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>) suggests purely Italian associations. The final incident
                        in the poem, ‘Hylax in limine latrat’ (though the name given to the dog is
                        Greek), is a touch of natural life, such as does not often occur in the
                        Eclogues. On the whole, Virgil seems here to have struck on a vein which it
                        may be regretted that he did not work more thoroughly. If, as has been
                        suggested by Mr. Symonds, in his account and translations of popular Tuscan
                        poems, any of the Eclogues of Virgil are founded on primitive love-songs
                        current among the peasantry of Italy, the songs of Damon and Alphesiboeus
                        are those which we should fix on as being the artistic development of these
                        native germs. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The tenth Eclogue was the last in order of composition, probably an
                        after-thought written immediately before the final publication, or perhaps
                        before the second edition, of the nine other poems. In this poem Virgil
                        abandons the more realistic path on which he had entered in the eighth, and
                        returns again to the vague fancies of the old pastoral lament for Daphnis,
                        as it is sung in the first idyl of Theocritus. Nothing can be more remote
                        from actual fact than the representation of Gallus—the active and ambitious
                        soldier and man of affairs, at that time engaged in the defence of the
                        coasts of Italy—dying among the mountains of Arcadia, in consequence of his
                        desertion by Lycoris (a dancing-girl, and former mistress of Antony, whose
                        real name was Cytheris), and wept for by the rocks and pine-woods of
                        Maenalus and Lycaeus. Yet none of the poems is more rich in beauty, and
                        grace, and happy turns of phrase. As the idealised expression of unfortunate
                        love, this poem is of the same class as the second, and as the song of Damon
                        in the eighth. That vein of modern romantic sentiment, already noticed in
                        the second, the longing to escape from the ways of civilised life to the
                        wild and lonely places of Nature, and to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>follow in imagination ‘the homely, slighted shepherd’s trade,’ meets us

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The review of the Eclogues in the order of their composition shows that the
                        early art of Virgil, like the lyrical art of Horace, begins in imitation,
                        and, after attaining command over the form, rhythm, and diction of the type
                        of poetry which it reproduces, gradually assumes greater independence in the
                        choice of subject and the mode of treatment. The susceptibility of Virgil’s
                        mind to the grace and musical sweetness of Theocritus gave the first impulse
                        to the composition of the Eclogues; but this susceptibility was itself the
                        result of a natural sympathy with the sentiment and motives of the Greek
                        idyl, especially with the love of Nature and the passion of love. He found
                        this province of art unappropriated. He revealed a new vein of Greek feeling
                        unwrought by any of his countrymen. He gave another life to the beings,
                        natural and supernatural, of ancient pastoral song, and awoke in his native
                        land the sound of a strain hitherto unheard by Italian ears. The form of the
                        Greek idyl, whether in dialogue or monologue, suited his genius, as a
                        vehicle for the lighter fancies of youth, and for half-revealing,
                        half-concealing the pleasures and pains personal to himself, better than the
                        forms of lyrical and elegiac poetry adopted by Catullus and his compeers. In

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In order to understand the pastoral poetry of Virgil, both in its relation
                        to a Greek ideal and in its original truth of feeling, it is necessary to
                        remember the chief characteristics of its prototype in the age of Ptolemy
                        Philadelphus of Alexandria and in the early years of the reign of Hiero of
                        Syracuse. The pastoral poetry of Sicily was the latest creation of Greek
                        genius, born after the nobler phases of religious and political life, and
                        the epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry which arose out of them, had passed
                        away. In ancient, as in modern times, the pastoral idyl, as an artistic
                        branch of literature, has arisen, not in a simple age, living in unconscious
                        harmony with Nature, but from the midst of a refined and luxurious,
                        generally, too, a learned or rather bookish society, and has tried to give
                        vent to the feelings of men weary of an artificial life and vaguely longing
                        to breathe a freer air<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a>. But there was in ancient
                        times a primitive and popular, as well as a late and artistic pastoral. Of
                        the primitive pastoral, springing out of rustic gatherings and festivals, or

                        their flocks. The author of the Iliad absorbed the spirit of this primitive
                        poetry in the greater compass of his epic creation, as Shakspeare has
                        absorbed the Elizabethan pastoral within the all-embracing compass of his
                        representation. Much of the imagery of the Iliad, several incidents casually
                        introduced in connexion with the names of obscure persons perishing in
                        battle, some of the supernatural events glanced at, as of the meeting of
                        Aphrodite with Anchises while tending his herds on the spurs of Ida,—a
                        subject of allusion also in the Sicilian idyl,—are of a pastoral character
                        and origin. In the lines which spring up with a tender grace in the midst of

                        or of that older branch of the family to which the name Pelasgic has been
                        vaguely given, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and may have lingered on the

                        the earliest writer who is said to have adopted this native plant of the
                        mountains and the woods, and to have trained it to assume some form of art,
                        was Stesichorus of Himera, who flourished about the beginning of the sixth
                        century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> But nothing more is heard of it till

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Some of the primitive modes of feeling which gave birth to the earliest
                        pastoral song still survive, though in altered form, in this later Sicilian
                        poetry. The song of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">βουκόλοι</span></span>, or herdsmen, like the song of the
                        masked worshippers of Bacchus (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">τραγῳδία</span></span>), may be traced to that
                        stage in the development of the higher races in which Nature was the chief
                        object of worship and religious sympathy. Under the symbols of Linus,
                        Daphnis, or Adonis, the country people of early times lamented the decay of
                        the fresh beauty of spring, under the burning midsummer heat<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>. This primitive germ of
                        serious feeling has perpetuated itself in that melancholy mood which runs
                        through the pastoral poetry of all countries. From that tendency of the
                        Greek imagination to give a human meaning to all that interested it, this
                        dirge over the fading beauty of the early year soon assumed the form of a
                        lament over the death of a young shepherd-poet, dear to gods and men, to the
                        flocks, herds, and wild animals, to the rocks and mountains, among which he
                        had lived. In the Daphnis of Theocritus, the human passion of love produces
                        that blighting influence on the life of the shepherd which in the original
                        myth was produced by the fierce heat of summer on the tender life of the
                        year. A still later development of the myth appears in the lament over the
                        extinction of youthful genius by early death. It is not in any poem of
                        Theocritus, but in the ‘Lament of Bion,’—the work of a later writer,
                        apparently an Italian-Greek,— </p>

                        from this new form of the old dirge of Linus or Daphnis that the fancies and
                        feelings of the ancient pastoral have been most happily adapted to modern
                        poetry, as in the Lycidas, the Adonais, and the Thyrsis of English
                        literature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another traditional theme of ‘pastoral melancholy,’ of which Theocritus
                        makes use, is the unrequited love of the Cyclops for Galatea. This too had
                        its origin in the personification of natural objects<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a>. But, unlike the song of Daphnis, the myth of which it was
                        the expression was purely local, and confined to the shores of Sicily. It
                        also illustrates the tendency of all pastoral song to find its chief human
                        motive in the passion of love. While the original motive of the primitive
                        lament for Daphnis or Linus was the unconscious sympathy of the human heart
                        with Nature, the most prominent motive of artistic pastoral or idyllic
                        poetry, from the ‘Song of Songs’ to the ‘Hermann and Dorothea’ and ‘The Long
                        Vacation Pastoral’ of these later times, has been the passion of the human
                        heart for the human object of its affection, blending with either an
                        unconscious absorption in outward scenes or a refined contemplation of
                            them<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there is another very distinct mode of primitive feeling traceable in
                        Theocritus, which dictates the good-humoured, often licentious, banter with
                        which the shepherds encounter one another. As the pastoral monologue
                        continued to betray the serious character of the Lament out of which it
                        sprung, so this natural dialogue continued to bear traces of that old
                        licence of the harvest-home and the vintage-season, which </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ‘lusit amabiliter’ of Horace’s lines, which soon became inapplicable to
                        the biting and censorious Italian spirit, expresses happily the tone of the
                        dialogue in the fourth and fifth Idyls of Theocritus, which Virgil attempts
                        to reproduce in his third Eclogue. This source of rural poetry was known to
                        the ‘Ausonian husbandmen’ as well as to the country people of Greece and
                        Sicily: and its native force passed not only into the Greek pastoral idyl,
                        but into the Sicilian comedy of Epicharmus and the old comedy of Athens,
                        and, through a totally different channel, into Roman satire. There is,
                        however, another form in which the pastoral dialogue appears both in
                        Theocritus and Virgil, namely, of extemporaneous contests in song. Probably
                        these more artistic contests and the award of prizes to the successful
                        competitor had their origin in the bantering dialogue of the shepherds; as
                        the tragic contests at the Dionysian festivals had their origin in the
                        rivalry with which the masked votaries of Dionysus poured forth their
                        extemporaneous verses, in sympathy with the sufferings of their god. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such were the first rude utterances of the deeper as well as the gayer
                        emotions of men, living in the happy security of the country districts or
                        the ‘otia dia’ of the mountains in Greece, Sicily, and perhaps Southern
                        Italy, which the art of Theocritus and his successors cast into artistic
                        forms and measures suited to the taste of educated readers. How far, in the
                        manner in which he accomplished this, Theocritus had been anticipated by
                        ‘the grave muse of Stesichorus,’ and whether this wild product of the
                        mountains was of a native Siculian or an Hellenic stock, it is not possible
                        to determine. A citizen of Syracuse, in the palmy days of Hiero, before
                        there was any dream of Roman conquest; deeply susceptible of the beauty of
                        his native island, but, like a Greek, seeing this beauty in relation to
                        human associations; familiar with the songs and old traditions of the land,
                        as well as with the fancies of earlier poets; living his life in friendly
                        association with his literary compeers, such as the Alexandrine Aratus<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a> and Nicias, the physician and

                        wood, brook, and sea-shore with an ideal race of shepherds, in whom the
                        natural emotions and grotesque superstitions of actual herdsmen should be
                        found in union with the refinement, the mythological lore, the keen sense of
                        the beauty, not unmixed with the melancholy, of life, characteristic of a
                        circle of poets and scholars enjoying their youth in untroubled and
                        uneventful times. All his materials, old and new, assumed the shape of
                        pictures from human life in combination with the representations of the
                        sounds, sights, and living movement of Nature. The essential characteristic
                        both of his pastoral Idyls and of those drawn from city-life, such as the
                        second, fourteenth, and fifteenth, is what has been well called the
                        ‘disinterested objectivity<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>’ of Greek art: and this is the chief note of their
                        difference from Virgil’s pastorals. Even where, as in the seventh, the poet
                        introduces himself on the scene, he appears as one, and not the most
                        important, of the personages on it. He does not draw attention to his own
                        feelings or fortunes, only to his playful converse and rivalry in song with
                        the young shepherd-poet Lycidas, ‘with the bright laughing eye and the smile
                        ever playing on his lip<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It may be urged against these Idyls that, as compared with the best modern
                        Idyls, in prose or verse, they are, for the most part, wanting in incident
                        or adventure; and this charge is equally applicable to Virgil’s pastorals.
                        But there is always dramatic vivacity and consistency in the personages of
                        Theocritus, and this cannot equally be said of those introduced into the
                        Eclogues. It might be urged also against the representations of Theocritus,
                        and still more against those of Virgil, that the ‘vestigia ruris’ have been
                        too carefully obliterated. Yet, though not drawn immediately from life, this
                        picture of Sicilian shepherds and peasants, possessed with the vivid belief
                        in Pan and the Nymphs, singing the old dirge of the herdsman Daphnis <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>among the mountain pastures, or the
                        love-song of the Cyclops and Galatea on the rocks overhanging the Sicilian
                        sea, or the song of Lityerses among the ripe corn-fields<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a>, challenging each other to compete in song or plying each
                        other with careless tending their flocks rather as a picturesque pastime
                        than as a toilsome occupation, and living a life of free social enjoyment in
                        the open air, was a genuine ideal of the Greek imagination, not perhaps, too
                        far removed from the actual reality. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before the time of Virgil there had been no attempt to introduce this form
                        of art into Italy. Though the germ of a rude rustic poetry existed in the
                        ‘Fescennine verses,’ no connexion can be traced between them and the highly
                        artificial pastoral of the Augustan Age. The Eclogues of Virgil are in form
                        and even in substance a closer reproduction of a Greek original than any
                        other branch of Latin literature, with the exception of the comedy of
                        Terence. The ‘Lament of Daphnis,’ the song of unrequited love, the bantering
                        dialogues of the shepherds and their more formal contests in song, reappear
                        in Latin tones and with some new associations of individual and national
                        life, but in such a manner as to recall the memory of the Sicilian idyl
                        rather than to suggest a new experience from life. And yet Virgil is not
                        satisfied, like the authors of Latin comedy, with presenting to the
                        imagination types of Greek life, Greek sentiment and manners, and Greek
                        scenes. He desires not only to reproduce in new words and music the charm
                        which had fascinated him in Theocritus, but to blend the actual feeling and
                        experience of an Italian living in the Augustan Age with this ideal restored
                        from a by-gone time. The result is something composite, neither purely Greek
                        nor purely Italian; not altogether of the present time nor yet of a mythical
                        foretime; but a blending of various elements of poetic association and
                        actual experience, as in those landscapes of the Renaissance which combine
                        aspects of real scenes with the suggestions of classical poetry, and
                        introduce figures of the day in modern dress <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>along with the fantastic shapes of mythological invention. The scenes and
                        personages of the Eclogues are thus one stage further removed from actuality
                        than those of the Greek pastoral. They do not reproduce, as Keats has done,
                        the Greek ideal of rural life, and they do not create a purely Italian
                        ideal. There was, indeed, latent in the Italian imagination an ideal of a
                        homely rustic life, finding its happiness in the annual round of labour and
                        in the blessing of a virtuous home, and that ideal Virgil loved to draw with
                        ‘magic hand;’ but that was altogether unlike the ideal of the Greek
                        imagination. The life of industry and happiness which Virgil glorifies in
                        the Georgics,—that of the ‘primitive, stout-hearted, and thrifty
                        husbandmen’ of Horace,—whose pride was in their ‘glad harvests,’ their
                        ‘trim fields,’ their ‘vineyards,’ and in the use which they derived from
                        their flocks, herds, and beehives, had nothing in common with that of the
                        ‘well-trimmed sunburnt shepherds’ whom Greek fancy first created, and whom
                        Keats has made live for us again, enjoying the fulness of actual existence
                        in union with the dreams of an ‘Elysian idleness<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a>.’ Least of all could the pastoral life of Arcadia or Sicily
                        have been like the habitual ways of men in the rich plains of Mantua. The
                        district of Italy most like the scenes of the Greek idyl was Calabria,
                        where, among the desolate forest-glades, the herds and flocks of some rich
                        senator or eques were now tended by barbarous slaves, with whose daily
                        existence the ideal glories of pastoral song were not likely to intermingle.

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is easy for those who wish to depreciate the art of Virgil to point out
                        very many instances of imitation and artificial treatment in the Eclogues,
                        and to establish their manifest inferiority to the Greek idyl in direct
                        truth and vividness of representation. They are not purely objective, like
                        the Greek idyl, nor purely subjective as the Latin elegy generally is. They
                        are very much inferior to the Greek originals in dramatic power; and the
                        idyl is really a branch of dramatic poetry. Like the pure drama, it depends
                        on the power of living in the thoughts, situations, and feelings of beings
                        quite distinct from the poet himself. Some of the Eclogues, those in which
                        the passion of love and the Italian passion for the land are the motives,
                        are dramatic in spirit, though the conception of the situation is not
                        consistently maintained. But in most cases, where he is not merely
                        imitative, the dramatic form is to Virgil as a kind of veil under which he
                        may partially reveal what moved him most in connexion with his own personal
                        fortunes, and may express his sympathies with literature, with outward
                        nature, and with certain moods and sentiments of the human heart. It is not
                        in virtue of the originality and consistency of their conception, but of
                        their general truth of feeling and the perfection of the medium through
                        which that feeling is conveyed, that those who admire the Eclogues must
                        vindicate their claim to poetic honour. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The reserve with which all his personal relations are indicated, and the
                        allusive way in which the story of his fortunes is told, are in keeping with
                        the delicacy and modesty of Virgil’s nature. He tells us nothing directly of
                        his home-life or occupations, though his attachment to the scenes familiar
                        to him from childhood is felt in the language with which Meliboeus
                        felicitates Tityrus on the restitution of his land, and in that in which
                        Moeris and Lycidas discourse together. We know of no actual Galatea or
                        Amaryllis associated with the joy or the pain of his youth; though his
                        subtle perception of the various moods of the passion of love can hardly be
                        a mere poetic intuition, unen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lightened by
                        personal experience. The eminent men with whom he was brought into contact,
                        Octavianus, Pollio, Varus, and Gallus, are not individualised; though the
                        different feelings of reverential or loyal respect, of colder deference, or
                        admiring enthusiasm, which they severally excited in him, can be clearly
                        distinguished. In the undesigned revelation of himself, which every author
                        makes in his writings, there are few indications of the religious and moral
                        feeling and of the national sentiment which are among the principal elements
                        in Virgil’s maturer poems: but we find abundantly the evidence of a mind
                        open to all tender and refined influences, free from every taint of envy or
                        malice, serious and pensive, and finding its chief happiness in making the
                        charm, which fascinated him in books, in Nature, and in life, heard in the
                        deep and rich music of the language, of which he first drew out the full
                        capabilities:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Eclogues also present Virgil to us as not only a poet, but, as what he
                        continued to be through all his life, a student of the writings of the past.
                        Like Milton he was eminently a learned poet, and, like Milton, he knew the
                        subtle alchemy by which the duller ore of learned allusion is transmuted
                        into gold. The tales of the Greek mythology and the names of places famous
                        in song or story act on his imagination, not so much through their own
                        intrinsic interest, as through the associations of literature. It is under
                        this reflex action that he recalls to memory the tales of Pasiphae, of
                        Scylla and Nisus, of Tereus and Philomela; introduces Orpheus, Amphion, and
                        Linus as the ideal poets of pastoral song; and alludes to Hesiod, Euphorion,
                        and Theocritus in the phrases ‘the sage of Ascra,’ ‘the verse of Chalcis,’
                        ‘the Sicilian Shepherd.’ It is in this spirit that he associates the musical
                        accompaniment of his song with the names of Maenalus and Eurotas, of Rhodope
                        and Ismarus; and that he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>speaks of bees and
                        thyme as ‘the bees and thyme of Hybla,’ of doves as ‘the Chaonian doves,’ of
                        vultures as ‘the birds of Caucasus.’ He also characterises objects by local
                        epithets, suggestive rather of the associations of geographical science than
                        of poetry. Thus he speaks of ‘Ariusian wine,’ of ‘Cydonian arrows,’ ‘Cyrnean
                        yews,’ ‘Assyrian spikenard,’ and the like. The interest in physical
                        enquiries appears in the allusion in Ecl. iii. 40, </p>

                        these localising epithets, where there is nothing in the context to call up
                        any thought of the locality indicated, may appear to a modern reader an

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the Georgics and Aeneid, as well as in the Eclogues, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Virgil shows a great susceptibility to the beauty and power
                        of Nature. But Nature presents different aspects and awakens a different
                        class of feelings in these poems. In the Eclogues he shows a great openness
                        and receptivity of mind, through which all the softer and more delicate
                        influences of the outward world enter into and become part of his being. The
                        ‘molle atque facetum’ of Horace denotes the yielding susceptibility<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> to
                        outward influences, and the vivacity which gives them back in graceful
                        forms. In the Georgics, the sense of the relation of Nature to human energy
                        imparts greater nobleness to the conception. She appears there, not only in
                        her majesty and beauty, but as endowed with a soul and will. She stands to
                        man at first in the relation of an antagonist: but, by compliance with her
                        conditions, he subdues her to his will, and finds in her at last a just and
                        beneficent helpmate<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>. In the Eclogues she takes rather the form of an enchantress, who,
                        by the charm of her outward mien and her freely-offered gifts, fascinates
                        him into a life of indolent repose. If the one poem may in a sense be
                        described as the ‘glorification of labour,’ the other might be described as
                        the ‘glorification of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dolce far niente</span></span>’ of
                        Italian life. The natural objects described by Virgil are often indeed the
                        same as those out of which the representation of Theocritus is composed; but
                        in Theocritus the human figures are, after all, the prominent objects in the
                        picture: the speakers in his dialogue, though not unconscious of the charm
                        proceeding from the scenes in which they are placed, yet are not possessed
                        by it; they do not lose their own being in the larger life of Nature
                        environing them. Theocritus shows everywhere the social temperament of the
                        Greeks. It is an Italian, not perhaps without something of the Celtic fibre
                        in his composition, who utters his natural feelings in the lines, </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In Virgil’s representation neither the scenes nor the human figures are so
                        distinctly present to the eye; but there is diffused through it a subtle
                        influence from the outward world, bringing man’s nature into conformity with
                        itself. The genius in modern times, which shows most of this yielding
                        susceptibility to the softer aspects and motions of Nature, is that of
                        Rousseau; but in the manner in which he gives way to this sentiment there is
                        a want of restraint, a strain of excited feeling, suggestive of the contrast
                        between this transient intoxication of happiness and the abiding unrest and
                        misery of all his human relations. In reading Virgil there is no sense of
                        any such jarring discord; yet it is rather as a pensive emotion, not
                        unallied to melancholy, than as the joy of a sanguine temperament, that his
                        susceptibility to outward impressions is made manifest. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The objects through which Nature exercises this spell are, as was said, much
                        the same as those out of which the landscape of Theocritus is composed.
                        Virgil, like Theocritus, enables us to feel the charm of ‘the sparkling
                        stream of fresh water,’ of ‘mossy fountains and grass softer than sleep,’ of
                        ‘the cool shade of trees,’ and of caves ‘with the gadding vine o’ergrown.’
                        The grace and tender hues of wild flowers—violets, poppies, narcissus, and
                        hyacinth—and of fruits, such as the ‘cerea pruna’ and the ‘tenera lanugine
                        mala,’—the luxuriant vegetation clothing the rocks and the ideal mountain
                        glades,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> the plants and trees,—osiers and hazels, ilex and beech,—the woods, and
                        meadow-pastures, and rich orchards of his native district, have communicated
                        the soul and secret of their being to the mellow tones of his language and
                        the musical cadences of his verse. He makes us hear again, with a strange
                        delight, the murmur of bees feeding on the willow hedge, the moan of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>turtle-doves from the high elm tree, the
                        sound of the whispering south wind, of waves breaking on the shore, of
                        rivers flowing down through rocky valleys, the song of the woodman plying
                        his work, the voice of the divine poet chanting his strain. By a few simple
                        words he calls up before our minds the genial luxuriance of spring, the
                        freshness of early morning, the rest of all living things in the burning
                        heat of noon, the stillness of evening, the gentle imperceptible motions of
                        Nature, in the shooting up of the young alder-tree and in the gradual
                        colouring of the grapes on the sunny hill-sides. If the labour of man is
                        mentioned at all, it is in the form of some elegant accomplishment or
                        picturesque task—pruning the vine or grafting the pear-tree, closing the
                        streams that water the pastures, watching the flocks and herds feeding at
                        their own will. The new era on which the world was about to enter is seen by
                        his imagination, like the vision of some pastoral valley, half hidden, half
                        glorified through a golden haze. The peculiar blessings anticipated in that
                        era are the rest from labour, the spontaneous bounty of Nature, the peace
                        that is to reign among the old enemies of the animal kingdom. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The human affections which mingle with these representations of Nature are
                        the love of home, and the romantic sentiment, rather than the passion, of
                        love. The common human feeling of the love of home Virgil realises more
                        intensely from his love of the beauty associated with his own home. Many of
                        the sayings of Tityrus and Meliboeus bear witness to the strong hold which
                        their lands and flocks had on men of their class:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil tells, in language of natural pathos and exquisite grace, of the poor
                        man’s sorrow in yielding his thatched hut, his well-trimmed fields, his corn
                        crops, his pear-trees and his vines, the familiar sight of his goats feeding
                        high up among the thickets of the rocks, to some rude soldier, incapable
                        either of enjoying the charm or profiting by the richness of the land. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The three poems—the second, eighth, and tenth—of which love is the theme
                        are all of a serious and plaintive cast. There are few touches in Virgil’s
                        art descriptive either of the happier or the lighter and more playful
                        experiences of the passion, which are the common theme of Horace’s Odes.
                        Still less does he treat the subject in the style of Propertius and Ovid.
                        The sentiment of Virgil is more like that of Tibullus; only Virgil gives
                        utterance, though always in a dramatic form, to the real despair of
                        unrequited affection (indigni amoris), while the tone of Tibullus is rather
                        that of one yielding to the luxury of melancholy when in possession of all
                        that his heart desires. They each give expression to that modern mood of
                        passion, in which the heart longs to exchange the familiar life of
                        civilisation for the rougher life of the fields, and to share some humble
                        cottage and the daily occupations of peasant life with the beloved
                            object<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a>. In Virgil also there appears some anticipation of that
                        longing for lonely communing with Nature in her wilder and more desolate
                        aspects which we associate with romantic rather than with classical poetry. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Though, unlike all other Latin poets, Virgil avoids all reference to the
                        sensual side of this passion, there is no ancient poet who has analysed and
                        expressed, with equal truth and beauty and with such a chivalrous devotion,
                        the fluctuations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>between hope and despair,
                        the sense of personal unworthiness, the sweet memories, the heart-felt
                        longings, the self-forgetful consideration and anxieties of an idealising
                        affection. In such lines as these, expressing at once the sense of
                        unworthiness and the rapid sinking of the heart from hope to despair— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The supreme excellence of Virgil’s art consists in the perfect harmony
                        between his feeling and the medium through which it is conveyed. The style
                        of his longer poems has many varied excellences, in accordance with the
                        varied character of the thought and sentiment which it is called on to
                        express. But the strong and full volume of diction and rhythm and the
                        complex harmonies of the Georgics would have been an inappropriate vehicle
                        for the luxurious sentiment of the Eclogues. The attitude of the poet’s mind
                        in the composition of these earlier poems was that of a genial passiveness
                        rather than that of creative activity. There are few poems of equal
                        excellence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in which so little use is made
                        of that force of words which imparts new life to things. A few such
                        expressions might be quoted, like that given by Wordsworth as ‘an instance
                        of a slight exertion of the faculty of imagination in the use of a single

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But this actively imaginative use of language seldom occurs in these poems.
                        The general effect of the style is produced by the fulness of feeling, the
                        sweetness or sonorousness of cadence, with which words, used in their
                        familiar sense, are selected and combined. Such epithets as ‘mollis,’
                        ‘lentus,’ ‘tener’ are of frequent recurrence, yet the impression left by
                        their use is not one of weakness, or of a satiating luxury of sentiment. The
                        soft outlines and delicate bloom of Virgil’s youthful style are as true
                        emblems of health as the firmer fibre and richer colouring of his later
                        diction. What an affluence of feeling, what a deep sense of the happiness of
                        life, of the beauty of the world, of the glory of genius, is conveyed by the
                        simple use of the words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fortunatus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formosus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">divinus</span></span> in the lines— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More even in his rhythm than in his diction does Virgil’s superiority
                        appear, not only over all the poets of his country, but perhaps over all
                        other poets of past times, except Homer, Milton, and Shakspeare, in those
                        passages in which his dramatic art admits of a richly musical cadence. Our
                        ignorance of the exact pronunciation of Greek in the Alexandrian Age makes a
                        comparison between the effect that would have been produced by the rhythm of
                        Theocritus and the rhythm of the Eclogues in ancient times difficult or
                        impossible. Yet it may be allowed to say this much, that if the rhythm of
                        the Eclogues does not seem to us to attain to the natural and liquid flow of
                        the Greek idyl, yet its tones are deeper, they seem to come from a stronger
                        and richer source, than any which we can elicit from the Doric reed. Rarely
                        has the soothing and reviving charm of the musical sounds of Nature and of
                        the softer and grander harmonies of poetry been described and reproduced
                        more effectively than in these lines:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The objections often urged against the poetical value of the Eclogues may be
                        admitted. They are imitative in form. They do not reproduce scenes and
                        characters from actual life, nor are they consistent creations of the
                        imagination. They do not possess the interest arising from a contemplative
                        insight into the hidden workings of Nature, nor from reflection on the
                        problems of life. Their originality, their claim to be a representative work
                        of genius, consists in their truth and unity of sentiment and tone. If it be
                        said that the sentiment which they embody is but a languid and effeminate
                        sentiment, the admiration of two great poets, of the most masculine type of
                        genius that modern times have produced, is a sufficient answer to this
                        reproach. The admiration of Milton is proved by the conception and
                        workmanship of his ‘Lycidas,’ the most richly and continuously musical even
                        among his creations. Of Wordsworth’s admiration there is more than one
                        testimony,—this, from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the recently
                        published Memoir of the daughter of his early friend and associate in
                        poetry, perhaps the most direct: ‘I am much pleased to see (writes S.
                        Coleridge) how highly Mr. Wordsworth speaks of Virgil’s style, and of his
                        Bucolics which I have ever thought most graceful and tender. They are quite
                        another thing from Theocritus, however they may be based on Theocritus<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a>.’ The
                        criticism which the same writer applies to ‘Lycidas’ suggests the true
                        answer also to the objections urged against Virgil’s originality. ‘The best
                        defence of Lycidas is not to defend the design of it at all, but to allege
                        that the execution of it is perfect, the diction the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ne
                            plus ultra</span></span> of grace and loveliness, and that the spirit of the
                        whole is as original as if the poem contained no traces of the author’s
                        acquaintance with ancient pastoral poetry from Theocritus downwards.’ To the
                        names of these two poets we can now add the name of one of the most
                        illustrious, and certainly one of the least effeminate, among the critics
                        and men of letters whom this century has produced—Macaulay; who, after
                        speaking of the Aeneid in one of his letters, adds this sentence, ‘The
                        Georgics pleased me better; the Eclogues best,—the second and tenth above
                            all<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The appreciation of Wordsworth is a certain touchstone of the genuineness of
                        Virgil’s feeling for Nature. It is true that the sentiment to which he gives
                        expression in the Eclogues is only one, and not the most elevated, of the
                        many modes in which the spirit of man responds to the forms and movement of
                        the outward world. But the mood of the Eclogues is one most natural to man’s
                        spirit in the beautiful lands of Southern Europe. The freshness and softness
                        of Italian scenes are present in the Eclogues, in the rich music of the
                        Italian language, while it still retained the strength, fulness, and majesty
                        of its tones. These poems are truly representative of Italy, not as a land
                        of old civilisation, of historic renown, of great cities, of corn-crops, and
                        vineyards,—‘the mighty mother of fruits and men;’—but as a land of a soft
                        and genial air, beautiful with the tender <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>foliage and fresh flowers and blossoms of spring, and with the rich
                        colouring of autumn; a land which has most attuned man’s nature to the
                        influences of music and of pictorial art. As a true and exquisite symbol of
                        this vein of sentiment associated with Italy, the Eclogues hold a not
                        unworthy place beside the greater work—the ‘temple of solid marble’—which
                        the maturer art of Virgil dedicated to the genius of his country, and beside
                        the more composite but stately and massive monument which perpetuates the
                        national glory of Rome. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The appearance of the Eclogues marked Virgil out among his contemporaries as
                        the poet of Nature and rural life. That province was assigned to him, as
                        epic poetry was to Varius and tragedy to Pollio. It is to the Eclogues only
                        that the lines in which Horace characterises his art can with propriety be
                        applied. These lines were written before the appearance of the Georgics, and
                        probably before any considerable part of the poem had been composed<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a>. The epithets
                        which admirably characterise the receptive attitude of Virgil’s mind in the
                        composition of his pastoral poems are quite inapplicable to the solid and
                        severe workmanship and the earnest feeling of his didactic poem. The
                        Eclogues are the poems of youth, and of a youth passed in study and in
                        contact with Nature rather than with the serious interests of life. Though
                        Virgil indicates in them the ambition which was moving him to vaster
                        undertakings, yet he shows at the same time his consciousness of the
                        comparative triviality of his art. The class of poem to which the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ludere</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>applied
                        was, even when not of a licentious character, regarded by the more serious
                        minds of Rome, such as Cicero<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> for instance, with a certain degree of contempt,
                        as being among the ‘leviora studia,’ partaking more of the ‘Graeca levitas’
                        than of the ‘Roman gravitas<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a>.’ The genuine Roman
                        spirit demanded of its highest literature, as of its native architecture,
                        that it should either have some direct practical use, or contribute in some
                        way to enhance the sense of national greatness. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The literary impulse directing Virgil to the composition of the Georgics was
                        probably the wish to be the Hesiod, as he had already been the Theocritus,
                        of Rome. The poets of the Augustan Age selected some Greek prototype whose
                        manner they professed to reproduce and make the vehicle for the expression
                        of their own thought and experience. Thus Horace chose Alcaeus, Propertius
                        chose Callimachus as his model. Virgil assigns to Pollio the praise of alone
                        composing poems ‘worthy of the buskin of Sophocles.’ In the Georgics he
                        professes to find his own prototype in Hesiod:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Though Hesiod can scarcely have taken the highest rank as a poet, yet a
                        peculiar reverence attached to his name from his great antiquity, and from
                        the ethical and theological spirit of his writings. As Virgil chose the
                        mould of Theocritus into which to cast the lighter feelings and fancies of
                        his youth, he naturally turned to ‘The Works and Days of Hesiod’ as a more
                        suitable model for a poem on rural life, undertaken with a more serious
                        purpose, and demanding a severer treatment. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The change in Virgil’s life between the composition of the Eclogues and the
                        Georgics had however much more influence in determining the difference in
                        the character of the two poems, than the mere artistic desire to enter on a
                        new path of poetry. During the composition of the earlier poems Virgil was
                        living in a remote district of Italy, associating with the country-people or
                        with a few young poets like himself, and coming in contact with the great
                        world of action and national interests only through the medium of his
                        intercourse with the temporary governors of the province. Rome and its ruler
                        and the powerful stream of events in which his own fortunes were finally
                        absorbed affect his imagination as they might do that of one who heard of
                        them from a distance, but who in his ordinary thoughts and sympathies was
                        living quite apart from them; </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But before undertaking the task of writing the Georgics he had become an
                        honoured member of the circle of Maecenas, the intimate friend of Varius and
                        of Horace (who himself owed his introduction to that circle to the kindly
                        offices of the two older poets) and of others distinguished in literature
                        and public affairs. He had lived for a time near the centre of the world’s
                        movement, in close relations to the minds by which that movement was
                        directed. As the most genuine of his Eclogues had been inspired by his
                        personal share in the calamities of his country, it was natural that he
                        should, now when his own fortunes were restored through the favour of those
                        at the head of affairs, feel a stronger and more disinterested sympathy with
                        the public condition, at a crisis to which no one capable of understanding
                        its gravity could feel indifferent. It was natural that his new relations
                        and the impulse of the new ideas which came to him through them should move
                        him to undertake some work of art more suited to his maturer faculty, his
                        graver temperament, and the firmer fibre of his genius. Nor is there any
                        difficulty in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>believing that Maecenas may
                        have had some influence in determining him to the choice of a subject which
                        enabled him to range over the whole of that field of which he had already
                        appropriated a part, which would afford scope to the literary ambition
                        urging him to write a poem on a greater scale and of more enduring
                        substance, and which, at the same time, might serve indirectly to advance
                        the policy of reconciliation and national and social reorganisation which
                        Caesar and his minister were anxious to promote. Among ‘the ancient arts by
                        which the Latin name and the strength of Italy had waxed great,’ none had
                        fallen more into abeyance, through the insecurity of the times, than the
                        cultivation of the land. The restoration of the old ‘Coloni’ of Italy and
                        the revival of the great forms of national industry, associated with the
                        older and happier memories of Rome, had been a leading feature in the policy
                        of the great popular leaders from the Gracchi down to Julius Caesar. Among
                        the completed glories of the Augustan Age, Horace, some twenty years later,
                        specially notes the restoration of security and abundance to the land:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All Virgil’s early associations and sympathies would lead him to identify
                        himself with this object and with the interests and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>happiness of such representatives of the old rural life of
                        Italy as might still be found, or might arise again under a secure
                        administration. In proposing to himself some serious aim for the exercise of
                        his poetic gift, it was natural that he should have fixed on that of
                        representing this life in such a way as to create an aspiration for it, and
                        to secure for it the sympathy of the world. The language in which he speaks
                        of the poem as a task imposed on him by Maecenas need not be taken
                        literally: but it is no detraction from Virgil’s originality to suppose that
                        he, like Horace, was encouraged by the minister to devote his genius to a
                        purpose which would appeal equally to the sympathies of the statesman and of
                        the poet. The testimony of Virgil’s biographer on this subject, which may
                        probably be traced to the original testimony of Melissus, the freedman of
                        Maecenas, is neither to be disregarded nor unduly pressed, any more than the
                        language in which Virgil himself makes acknowledgment of his indebtedness.
                        It is impossible to say what chance seed of casual conversation may have
                        been the original germ of what ultimately became so large and goodly a
                        creation. If, in the composition of the Georgics, Virgil employed his art as
                        an instrument of government, we cannot doubt that he did so not only because
                        he recognised in the subject of the poem one suited to his own genius, but
                        because his past life and early associations brought home to him the
                        desolation caused in the rural districts by the Civil Wars, the moral worth
                        of that old class of husbandmen who had suffered from them, and the public
                        loss arising from the diminution in their number and influence. To idealise
                        the life of that class by describing, with realistic fidelity and in the
                        language of purest poetry, the annual round of labour in which it was
                        passed; to suggest the ever-present charm arising from the intimate contact
                        with the manifold processes and aspects of Nature into which man is brought
                        in this life of labour; to contrast the simplicity and sanctity of such life
                        with the luxury and lawless passions of the great world; and to associate
                        this ideal with the varied beauty of Italy and the historic memories of
                        Rome, were objects worthy of one who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>aspired to fulfil the office of a national poet. It is no detraction from
                        the originality of his idea to suppose that some such suggestion as that
                        attributed to Maecenas gave the original impulse to the poem. Not only the
                        art, genius, and learning, but the religious faith and feeling, the moral
                        and national sympathies, which give to it its peculiar meaning and value,
                        are all the poet’s own. His strong feeling for his subject was as little
                        capable of being communicated from without, as the genius with which he
                        adorns it<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With such feelings as those which were moving the imagination of Virgil, a
                        modern poet might have shaped his subject into the form of a poetic idyl, in
                        which the joys and sorrows of men and women living during this national
                        crisis might have been represented in union with the varied aspects of the
                        scenery and the chief modes of rural industry in Italy. Such a form of art
                        would have enabled the poet to add the interest of individual character and
                        action to his abstract delineation of the ‘acer rusticus’ or the ‘duri
                        agrestes’ engaged in a hard struggle with the forces of Nature. And one or

                        encourage him to blend something more of idyllic representation with the
                        didactic and descriptive treatment of his subject. But the idyl which treats
                        the incidents of human life in the form either of a continuous poem or of a
                        tale in prose was unknown to the early art of Greece; and Roman imagination
                        was incapable of inventing a perfectly new mould into which to cast its
                        poetic fancies and feelings. Nor is it probable that a poem so truly
                        representative of Italy in all its aspects could have been produced in the
                        form of an idyl, of which the interest would have been concentrated on some
                        family or group of personages. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was only one form of literary art known to the Greeks or Romans of the
                        Augustan Age which was at all suitable for the treatment on a large scale of
                        such a subject as that which now filled the mind of Virgil. Next after the
                        epic poem of heroic action, the didactic epos was regarded at Rome as the
                        most serious and elaborate form of poetic art. It was more suited than any
                        other form to the Roman mind. It is the only form in which the genius of
                        Rome has produced master-pieces superior not only to anything of the kind
                        produced by Greece but to all similar attempts in modern times. As Roman
                        invention, stimulated by the practical sense of utility, by the passion for
                        vast and massive undertakings, and by the strong perception of order and
                        unity of design, devised a new kind of architecture for the ordinary wants
                        of life, so in accordance with the national bent to reduce all things to
                        rule, to impose the will of a master on obedient subjects, to use the
                        constructive and artistic faculties for some practical end, if it did not
                        create, it gave ampler compass, more solid and massive workmanship, and the
                        associations of great ideas to that form of poetic art which had been the
                        most meagre and unsubstantial of all those invented by the genius of Greece. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Moreover, a new form, or rather a form of more ample capacity, was required
                        to embody the new poetical feelings and experience which now moved the Roman
                        and Italian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mind. If less interest was felt
                        at Rome in following the course of individual destiny, the interest felt in
                        contemplating the outward aspect and secret movement of Nature was now
                        stronger than it had been in the great ages of Greek literature. Though the
                        vivid enjoyment of the outward world had unconsciously shaped the tales of
                        the early Greek mythology, and though this enjoyment had entered directly,
                        as a subordinate element, into the epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry of
                        Greece, and, more prominently, into the later poetry of Alexandria, and
                        although the phenomena and laws of Nature had aroused the speculative
                        curiosity of the early Greek philosophers, no poet before Lucretius had
                        treated of Nature, in the immensity of her range, in the primal elements and
                        living forces of her constitution, and, at the same time, in her manifold
                        aspects of beneficence and beauty, and of destructive energy, as the subject
                        of a great poem. The forms adopted by the great masters of Greek
                        poetry,—the epic, lyric, and dramatic writers,—whose essential business it
                        was to represent the actions and passions of men, were inapplicable to the
                        treatment of this new subject of man’s environment. Lucretius accordingly
                        had to take the outline of his form from the early physiological writers,
                        whom the Greeks scarcely ranked among their poets at all, and who, though
                        animated by the speculative passion to penetrate to the secret of Nature,
                        were not specially interested in her aspects of beauty or power, or in her
                        relation to the life of man. If he cannot claim the title of an inventor in
                        art, yet by adding volume and majesty to the rudimentary type of these early
                        writers, he gave to the ancient world the unique specimen of a great
                        philosophical poem. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So too Virgil, penetrated with the feeling of Nature in her relation to
                        human wants and enjoyment, and desirous to give an adequate expression to
                        this feeling, could derive no guidance from the nobler genius of Greece. To
                        find a suitable vehicle, he had to turn to the earliest and latest periods
                        of her literature. The didactic, as distinct from the philosophic or
                        contemplative poem, was the invention of a time prior to the existence of
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prose composition. It seems to have
                        arisen out of the impulse to convey instruction and advice on the management
                        of life generally, and especially on the best means of securing a livelihood
                        from the cultivation of the soil. The use of the language of poetry for a
                        purpose essentially practical and prosaic was justified, in that primitive
                        time, not only by the absence of any other organ of literary expression, but
                        also by the fact that, in such a time, all literary effort was the result of
                        animated feeling, and that the most common aspects of Nature, such as the
                        changes of the seasons or of night and day, and what seem now the most
                        familiar occupations of life, were apprehended by the lively mind of the
                        Greek with a fresh sense of wonder, which use deadens in eras of more
                        advanced civilisation. But while this sense of wonder imparts a poetical
                        colouring to the language of early didactic poetry, and while sufficient
                        harmony was secured for it by the training of the ear during centuries of
                        epic song, the form and structure of this kind of art was, as compared with
                        the other forms of Greek poetry, essentially rudimentary. The sole specimen
                        which has reached our times appears in the form of a personal address,
                        treating of a number of subjects not closely connected with one another,
                        interspersed with various episodes, and producing the impression of a
                        connected whole solely through the vivid personality of the writer. Didactic
                        poetry was absolutely rejected in the maturity of Greek genius, after the
                        rise of a prose literature had marked off clearly the separate provinces of
                        prose and poetry, and after Greek taste had become more exacting in its
                        demand of unity of impression and symmetry of form in every work of art. It
                        was revived again in the Alexandrian epoch, when the creative impulse was
                        lost, and life and its interests had become tamer, while at the same time
                        knowledge had greatly increased, and a kind of literary dilettanteism was
                        one of the chief elements in refined enjoyment. By the Alexandrine writers
                        the irregular and desultory treatment of Hesiod was abandoned. The didactic
                        poem was treated by them as one of the recognised branches of poetical art.
                        It still retained the general character <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
                        a personal address, which accident may have first suggested to Hesiod, and
                        which either his example or their own taste had imposed on the early
                        philosophic poets. The Alexandrine type of poem differed from that of Hesiod
                        by professing to convey systematic instruction on some definite branch of
                        knowledge, instead of offering practical directions on the best method of
                        carrying on some occupation, combined with a medley of precepts, moral,
                        religious, and ceremonial. The change may be compared to that which the
                        Roman satire underwent, from the inartistic medley of Ennius and Lucilius to
                        the systematic treatment of some special subject in the satire of Persius
                        and Juvenal. The primary aim of such writers as Aratus and Nicander was not
                        to communicate ideas capable of affecting the imagination, but to satisfy
                        intellectual curiosity by communicating interesting information. So soon as
                        this information ceased to be interesting, the value of their work was gone.
                        Thus although accident has handed down several specimens of the Alexandrine
                        type of didactic poetry, their chief literary use is to enable us, by
                        contrast, better to appreciate the genius which, by interfusing with the
                        materials used by them other elements deeply affecting the heart, the
                        imagination, and the moral sympathies, has given the world, instead of the
                        temporary gift of a little useful information, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">κτῆμα ἐς ἀεί</span></span>
                        which it possesses in the Georgics. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In that poem Virgil combines something of the spirit of the older or
                        primitive type of didactic poetry with the systematic treatment of their
                        subject employed by the Alexandrine Metaphrastae. He retains the old form of
                        a personal address, not only in the dedication of the poem to Maecenas, but
                        in the manner in which he inculcates his precepts on the husbandman, or
                        indicates what he himself would do in particular circumstances<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>. Yet he bears more resemblance to the poets of Alexandria
                        in his systematic treatment and arrangement of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his materials. He aims, like them, at communicating a large
                        body of unfamiliar knowledge, as well as conveying practical precepts
                        founded on experience. By combining these two aims, but much more by making
                        the aims of conveying precept and instruction altogether subsidiary to that
                        of moving the imagination and the affections, Virgil, if he has not created
                        a new type of didactic poetry, has at least produced almost the only
                        specimen of it which the world cares to read. He is apparently conscious of
                        the difficulty of imparting to a poem of this type a continuous poetical
                        charm; as Lucretius, with more reason, is conscious of the difficulty of
                        securing a sustained poetical interest for his argumentative processes and
                        his investigations into the first principles of things. Virgil’s difficulty
                        is to maintain his subject on the level of poetical feeling, while at the
                        same time adhering to the necessities of practical instruction. And this
                        difficulty attaches to every kind of didactic poetry. He had to associate
                        with a poetic charm, not only the fair results of the husbandman’s labour,
                        the ‘heavy harvests and the Massic juice of the vine,’ but the processes and
                        mechanical appliances through which these fair results were obtained.
                        Although his idea of his art did not demand an exhaustive treatment of all
                        the operations of rural industry, such as was demanded of the prose writers
                        on the subject, yet it did demand that, in making his selection, he should
                        regard the importance of each topic in connexion with the work of the farm
                        as well as its adaptation to poetic treatment. It cannot be denied that this
                        necessary infusion of prosaic matter deprives even the most perfect specimen
                        of didactic poetry of that purity of imaginative interest which pervades the
                        masterpieces of epic, lyrical, and dramatic genius: but it is, on the other
                        hand, a great triumph of art to have redeemed so much as Virgil has done
                        from the homely realities of life into the more sacred ground of poetry, and
                        that without sacrifice either of the truth of fact or of the dignity and
                        sobriety of expression. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While the title ‘Georgica’ reminds us that the form of the poem, like the
                        form of the ‘Bucolica’ and the ‘Aeneis,’ was derived from the Greeks, the
                        subject of which it treats was one of peculiarly national interest. As the
                        Aeneid may be said to be inspired by the idea of Rome and her destiny, and
                        as the practical purpose of that poem was to confirm the faith of the Romans
                        in their Empire and in the ruler in whom that Empire was vested, so the
                        Georgics may be said to be inspired by the idea of Italy; and the true aim
                        of the poem was to revive and extend the love of the land, and to restore
                        the fading ideal of a life of virtue and happiness, passed in the labours of
                        a country life. But while much of the materials and of the workmanship of
                        the Aeneid is originally due to Greek invention, the general substance of
                        the Georgics and the most essentially poetical passages are of native
                        origin. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chief modes of rural industry treated in the various books are those
                        which flourished in Italy,—the tillage of the land for various crops, the
                        cultivation of the vine and the olive, the breeding and rearing of cattle,
                        sheep, and horses, and the tending of bees. It is noticed by Servius that
                        the agricultural precepts of the poem apply only to Italy and not to other
                        lands: ‘Sane agriculturae huius praecepta non ad omnes pertinent terras, sed
                        ad solum situm Italiae.’ The frequent references to the products of other
                        lands serve to suggest by contrast the superiority of Italy in those which
                        are the special subject of the poem and which are most essential to human
                        well-being. Cato also is represented by Cicero<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> as resting the charm of a country life in the

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The number of Roman writers who treated in prose of this subject, both
                        before and after Virgil, testifies further to the strong national interest
                        attaching to it. Among these writers, Varro, the immediate predecessor of
                        Virgil, associates the subject directly with the pride which the Romans felt
                        in their country. He introduces the speakers in his Dialogue as holding
                        their conversation in the Temple of Tellus, and examining a map or painting
                        of Italy on the wall. One of the speakers addresses the others in these
                        words, ‘You who have travelled over many lands, have you ever seen any more
                        richly cultivated than Italy? I, indeed, have never seen any so richly
                        cultivated.’ He especially characterises the excellence of its corn-crops,
                        its vines, olives, and fruit-trees: ‘What spelt shall I compare to the
                        Campanian? what wheat to the Apulian? what wine to the Falernian? what oil
                        to that of Venafrum? is not Italy planted with trees, so that the whole of
                        it seems an orchard<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>?’ Other
                        authors, Virgil himself among them<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>, and Columella in the Introduction to his
                            treatise<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a>, testify to the pride which the Italians took
                        in their breed of horses and herds of cattle. And though the Italian bees
                        and their product were not so famous in poetry as the bees of Hymettus and
                        ‘the honey of Hybla,’ yet Horace speaks of the country near Tarentum as one
                        ‘where the honey yields not to the honey of Hymettus;’ and in another Ode,
                        in which he contrasts his own moderate estate with the resources of richer
                        men, he mentions Calabrian honey along with the wine of Formiae and the
                        fleeces of Gallic pastures among the chief sources of wealth:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This branch of his subject moreover enables Virgil to celebrate the floral
                        beauties of Italy, and to exhibit on a small scale a picture of a community
                        at once warlike, politic, and industrious, such as had been realised on the
                        soil of Italy, and especially in the old Roman Commonwealth, more completely
                        than among any other people. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The subject was moreover intimately associated with the national history.
                        Several of the early legends, such as those of Cincinnatus, and, in more
                        historical times, of Atilius Regulus and Curius Dentatus, attest the
                        prominence which agriculture enjoyed among the pursuits of the foremost men
                        in the Republic. The surnames of many noble families, patrician and
                        plebeian, such as the Lentuli, Stolones, Bubulci, Pisones, Dolabellae, and
                        the name of the great Fabian Gens, are connected etymologically with
                        agricultural occupations, products, or implements, and afford evidence of a
                        time when the men who filled the great offices of the State lived on their
                        own lands<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>, and were known for the success
                        with which they improved their farms. The passion to possess and subdue the
                        land was, in the early history of the Republic, the main motive power both
                        of the political and military history of Rome. Even down to the
                        establishment of the Empire there was no question which more divided the two
                        great parties in the State than that of the Agrarian laws. And though, after
                        the conquest of Italy, Roman wars were fought for dominion rather than for
                        new territory, yet the hope of owning land, if not on Italian yet on some
                        foreign soil, which he should hold by his sword as well as cultivate by his
                        plough, supported the Roman <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>soldier, even
                        under the Empire, through the long years of his service. The Roman
                        ‘colonies,’ the origin of so many famous European cities, were settlements
                        of ‘Coloni’ or cultivators of the soil. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus in the selection of his subject Virgil appealed to old national
                        associations and living tastes in a way in which no Greek poet could have
                        done in choosing any mode of practical industry for poetic treatment. Even
                        the details of direct instruction would attract a Roman reader by reminding
                        him of labours which he may often have watched and perhaps have shared.
                        Though Virgil found new sources of attraction by references to Greek
                        mythology and science, and though he availed himself of the diction of Greek
                        poets much inferior to himself in their perception of beauty and their power
                        over language, yet his materials are mainly drawn either from personal
                        observation, or from Italian writers who had put on record the results of
                        what they had seen and done. There is a thoroughly Roman character in the
                        technical execution of the poem, in the command over details, in the power
                        of orderly arrangement with a view to convenience rather than logical
                        symmetry, and in the combined sobriety and dignity of the workmanship. But
                        it is in the longer episodes, in which the deeper meaning of the poem is
                        most brought out, that the intimate connexion between the various topics
                        treated in it and the national character and fortunes becomes most apparent.
                        There is indeed one marked exception to the maintenance of this unity of
                        impression. The long episode in Book iv, from line 315 to 558, has no
                        national significance. And this is an undoubted blot on the artistic
                        perfection of the work. This episode not only adds nothing to its
                        representative character, but it suggests fancies and associations utterly
                        alien from the Italy of the Augustan Age. The space given to such a theme is
                        opposed to the truer taste of the poet, expressed in such lines as these— </p>

                        Emperor, that is responsible for this imperfection. The fourth Book
                        originally ended with an episode which afforded scope for the expression of
                        personal feeling, for awakening an interest in that land which was now of
                        vast importance to the State, and which affected the imagination of
                        cultivated Romans as it does that of cultivated men in modern times<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>, and for illustrating the national greatness
                        and the recent history of Rome. In the first edition the mention of Egypt at
                        line 287 had led Virgil to celebrate the administration of that province
                        under his early friend Cornelius Gallus. When Gallus fell into disgrace and
                        was forced to commit suicide in 26 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, Virgil
                        was required to re-edit the poem with a new concluding episode<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a>. The subject treated in the earlier edition of the poem
                        would have enabled Virgil to give renewed expression to his admiration and
                        affection for the Gallus of the Eclogues, to tell the tale of the downfall
                        of Cleopatra, and to magnify the greatness of Rome in the conquest and
                        government of her provinces. The episode as it now stands is a finished
                        piece of metrical execution; it illustrates the attraction which the Greek
                        mythological stories had for educated Romans; it is expressed in those tones
                        of tender pathos of which Virgil was a master; but it is at the same time a
                        standing proof of the malign <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>influence
                        which the Imperial despotism already exercised on the spontaneous
                        inspiration of genius, as well as on all sincere expression of feeling. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If the idea of the poem and of the national interests associated with it
                        arose in Virgil’s mind during his life in Rome, it was in his retirement in
                        Campania that he prepared himself for and executed his task. Like the Aeneid
                        it was a work of slow growth, the result of careful study and meditation.
                        Besides the great change of the concluding episode, there are some slight
                        indications that the poem was retouched in later editions; and perhaps a
                        very few lines added to the original work may have been either left finally
                        unadjusted to their proper place, or may have been transposed in the copying
                        of the manuscript<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a>. Although regard for his art was a more prominent
                        consideration in the mind of Virgil than of Lucretius, yet he did not, any
                        more than his predecessor, wish to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>separate
                        the office of a teacher from that of a poet. How far the experience of his
                        early years in the farm in the district of Andes or of his later residence
                        on his land near Nola may have contributed to his knowledge of his subject,
                        we have no means of knowing; but probably the delicacy of his health as well
                        as his devotion to study may have limited his experience to the observation
                        of the labours of others. But the power of vividly realising and enjoying
                        the familiar sights and work of the farm,—the life which he gives to the
                        notices of seed-time and harvest, of the growth of trees and ripening of
                        fruits, of the habits of flocks, herds, and bees, etc.,—the deep love for
                        his subject in all its details— </p>

                        manhood is, more often perhaps than we know, the conscious reproduction of
                        the unconscious impressions of early years, received in a susceptible and
                        retentive mind. Virgil, in common with all great poets, retained through
                        life the ‘child’s heart within the man’s.’ Through this geniality of nature

                        well as of native feeling. He combines in its varied and firm texture the
                        homely wisdom embodied in the precepts and proverbs of Italian peasants

                        Lucretius,—with the knowledge of natural history contained in the treatises
                        of Aristotle and Theophrastus, and the systematic practical directions of
                        the old prose writers on rural economy, such as the Carthaginian Mago<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>, whose work had been
                        translated into Latin,—Democritus and Xenophon among Greek prose
                        writers,—Cato, the two Sasernae, Licinius Stolo, Tremellius, and Varro
                        among Latin authors. The purely practical precepts of the Georgics were
                        apparently selected and condensed from these writers<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a>. But no literary inspiration or ideas were likely to have
                        come from any of these last-named authors, unless the Invocation in the
                        first Book may have been suggested by the example of Varro, who begins his
                        treatise with an invocation to the XII Di consentes. The proverbial sayings
                        or rustic songs embodying the traditional peasant lore, such as the ‘Quid
                        vesper serus vehit?’ and the ‘hiberno pulvere, verno luto, grandia farra,
                        Camille, metes<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a>,’ which add an
                        antique and homely charm to the poem, may have become known to Virgil from
                        the book of the Sasernae, who are quoted by Varro as authorities for many of
                        the old charms used by the primitive husbandmen, such as ‘Terra pestem
                        teneto, salus hic maneto,’ which is to be repeated ‘ter novies.’ Servius
                        notes that the words ‘sulco attritus splendescere vomer’ recall an old
                        saying of Cato, ‘Vir bonus est, mi fili, colendi peritus, cuius ferramenta
                            splendent<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>.’ The notices of
                        ceremonial observances, such as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the account
                        of the Ambarvalia, and the enumeration of things that might lawfully be done
                        on holy days<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a>, were probably derived from
                        the pontifical books and the sacred books of the other priestly colleges, of
                        which Virgil made large use also in the Aeneid. In all the writers on
                        practical farming, from Cato to Varro, he found that strong appreciation of
                        the supreme worth of rural industry and that strong interest in its
                        processes and results which justified him in identifying his subject with
                        the thought of the national life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Among the sources of literary inspiration from which Virgil drew in the
                        Georgics, the oldest, and not the least abundant, was the ‘Works and Days’
                        of Hesiod. Yet a comparison of the two poems shows immediately that the
                        Georgics do not, either in form or substance, stand in that close relation
                        to their prototype, in which the Eclogues on the one hand, and the Aeneid on
                        the other, stand to the idyls of Theocritus and to the epic poems of Homer.
                        The immediate influence of Hesiod is most apparent in the first Book of the
                        Georgics, in which the subject is treated in connexion with theological
                        ideas; while in the second Book and in the later Books, in which the
                        philosophical conception of Nature, though in subordination to the
                        conception of a supreme Spiritual power, becomes more prominent, the spirit
                        of Hesiod gives place to the spirit of Lucretius. There is, however, a real
                        affinity between the primitive piety of the old Boeotian bard and the
                        attitude in which Virgil contemplated the world, though the faith of Virgil
                        has become more rational under the speculative teaching and enquiry which
                        had taken the place of earlier modes of thought among the Greeks. Virgil is
                        ever seeking to produce a poetical reconcilement between primitive tradition
                        and more enlightened views both of moral and physical truth. Thus he
                        introduces the old fable of the creation of the present race of men in
                        immediate juxtaposition with the assertion of the ‘laws and eternal
                        conditions imposed by Nature on certain places.’ He accepts the belief in a
                        Golden Age and in the blight which fell on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>world under the dispensation of Jove; but he regards this
                        blight as sent, not in anger, but as a discipline and incentive to exertion.
                        He describes the natural progress of the various arts of life under this
                        stimulus, but still leaves room for divine intervention in the more
                        important discoveries:— </p>

                        popular at Rome, that it was not only imitated and almost incorporated in
                        his poem by Virgil, but had been translated by Cicero in his youth, and was
                        subsequently translated by Germanicus. Again, the description at iii. 425,
                        of the dangerous serpent that haunts the Calabrian pastures, is closely
                        imitated from the extant <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Θηριακά</span></span> of Nicander; nor can we doubt

                        imitations produces the impression not only of Virgil’s immense superiority

                        of the Latin hexameter, as an organ for expressing the beauty and power of
                        Nature, over the exotic jargon and unmusical jingle which those writers
                        compounded out of their epic studies and their scientific nomenclature. To

                        contemplation, are entirely Virgil’s own. So too in nearly all the
                        indications of stormy or bright weather, whether taken from natural
                        phenomena or the habits of animals, we find in the Latin poet some
                        suggestion of poetical analogy giving new life to the thing described, or
                        some touch of tender feeling, of which his original supplied him with no
                        hint whatever. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For the true poetry of the Georgics—the colour of human and sympathetic
                        feeling, the atmosphere of contemplative ideas, the ethical and national
                        associations with which the subject is surrounded—Virgil owes very little
                        to Greek inspiration. Much of this poetry is the mode in which his own
                        spirit interprets Nature and human life. But much also is due to the genius
                        of his great predecessor in Latin poetry, who, though ‘unnamed,’ is ‘not
                        unowned,’ but felt to be a pervading presence in the thought and feeling,
                        the creative diction and the grander cadences, of the Georgics. Yet this
                        influence is perhaps as potent in the antagonism as in the sympathy which it
                        evokes. Virgil is no mere disciple of Lucretius, either as regards his
                        philosophy or his art. Though <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his
                        imagination pays homage to that of the older poet; though he acknowledges
                        his contemplative elevation; though he has a strong affinity with the deep
                        humanity of his nature; yet in his profoundest convictions and aspirations
                        he proclaims his revolt from him. The key to the secret of much in the
                        composition of the Georgics,—of the condition of mind out of which this
                        work of genius assumed the shape it has as a great literary possession,—is
                        to be sought in the collision between the force of thought, imagination, and
                        feeling which the active spirit of Lucretius stored up and left behind him
                        as his legacy to the world, and the nature, strongly susceptible indeed,
                        but, at the same time, firm in its own convictions, which first felt the
                        shock of that force, in its attractive, stimulating, and repellent power.

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The influence, direct and indirect, exercised by Lucretius on the thought,
                        composition, and even the diction of the Georgics was perhaps stronger than
                        that ever exercised, before or since, by one great poet on the work of
                        another. This influence is of the kind which is oftener seen in the history
                        of philosophy than of literature. It was partly one of sympathy, partly of
                        antagonism. Virgil’s conception of Nature has its immediate origin in the
                        thought of Lucretius; his religious convictions and national sentiment
                        derive new strength by reaction from the attitude of his predecessor. This
                        powerful attraction and repulsion were alike due to the fact that Lucretius
                        was the first not only to reveal a new power, beauty, and source of wonder
                        in the world, but also to communicate to poetry a speculative impulse,
                        opening up, with a more impassioned appeal than philosophy can do, the great
                        questions underlying human life,—such as the truth of all religious
                        tradition, the position of man in the Universe, and the attitude of mind and
                        course of conduct demanded by that position. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor was it a poetical and speculative impulse only that Virgil received from
                        his predecessor. A new didactic poem, dealing largely with the same
                        subject-matter as that treated by Lucretius,—such as the earth, the
                        heavens, the great elemental forces, the growth of plants, the habits of
                        animals, and the like—contemplating, among other objects, that of
                        determining the relation of man to the sphere in which he is placed, and
                        seeking to invest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the ordinary processes of
                        Nature with an ideal charm,—could not help assuming a somewhat similar
                        mould to that which had been originally cast for the philosophic thought and
                        realistic observation of the older poet. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again, in regard to the technical execution of his work, rhythm and
                        expression, Virgil inherited the new wealth introduced into Latin literature
                        by Lucretius. Lucretius had given to the Latin Hexameter a stronger and more
                        unimpeded flow, a more sonorous and musical intonation than it had before
                        his time. He stamped the force of his mind on new modes of vivid expression
                        and of rhythmical cadence, which, though they might be modified, could not
                        be set aside in any future representation of the ‘species ratioque,’ the
                        outward spectacle and the moving principle of Nature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Many circumstances conduced to bring Virgil, more powerfully than any other
                        Latin poet, under the spell of Lucretius. As is remarked by Mr. Munro<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a>, when the poem of
                        his predecessor first appeared Virgil was at, or near, the age which is most
                        immediately impressed and moulded by a contemporary work of genius. The
                        enthusiasm for philosophy, expressed in the short poem written immediately
                        before he began to study under Siron, implies that he had been already
                        attracted by the subject of which Lucretius was the only worthy<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> Latin
                        exponent; and his studies under that teacher must have prepared his mind to
                        receive the higher instruction of the ‘De Rerum Natura.’ The song of Silenus
                        in the sixth Eclogue and many expressions and cadences in other poems of the
                        series attest the poetical, if not the speculative, impression thus
                        produced. But the clearest testimony of Virgil’s recognition of the
                        influence of his predecessor is found in that passage of the Georgics in
                        which he speaks of himself most from his heart,— </p>

                        keeping with the allusive style in which he writes of himself and others. He
                        seems rather in these passages to set forth two ideal states of mind, that
                        of philosophic contemplation, on the one hand, that of the pure love of
                        Nature and conformity with the simple beliefs of country-people, on the
                        other, as equally capable of raising men above the vulgar passions and
                        pleasures of the world. But it is evident that he thought of Lucretius as
                        the poet who had held up the one ideal to the imagination and the severer
                        mood of his countrymen, and of himself as holding up the other to their
                        poetical feeling and their human affections. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He would thus seem to have looked on Lucretius with something of that
                        veneration with which Lucretius regards Epicurus, Empedocles, and Ennius,
                        and with which Dante long after regarded Virgil himself. The two greatest
                        among the Roman poets had many feelings in common,—the love of Nature, the
                        love of study, especially the study of ancient poetry and of science, a
                        natural shrinking from the pomp and luxury of city-life and from the schemes
                        of worldly ambition, an abhorrence of the crimes and violence of civil war.
                        They felt the charm of the same kind of outward scenes,—of rivers flowing
                        through green pastures, of meadow and woodland, of rich corn-fields and
                        vineyards. They had the same strong sympathy with the life of animals
                        associated with man’s labour, the same fellow-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feeling with the pain and the happiness of which human
                        affection is the source. The numerous passages in which phrases or cadences,
                        thought or imagery in the Georgics recall phrases or representation in the
                        earlier poem<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>,
                        leave no doubt that Virgil found in Lucretius a heart and spirit with which
                        his own largely receptive nature could in many ways sympathise, as well as
                        that he recognised in him a guide whom he could follow in imagination ‘among
                        the lonely heights of Parnassus<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet, on the other hand, it is quite true that both the character and genius
                        of Virgil are essentially of a different type from those of Lucretius.—They
                        are both thoroughly original representatives of different elements in the
                        Roman and Italian character.—So far as he represents the mind and temper of
                        Rome, Lucretius represents the old order which had passed away. Though
                        scarcely anything is known of the circumstances of his life, yet his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gentile</span></span> name (as is shown by Mr. Munro), his relation
                        of equality to Memmius, the stamp of his powerful personality impressed on
                        his poem, point to the conclusion that he was one of the old Roman
                        aristocracy, born into a time when many of its members had begun to retire
                        in disgust from active interest in the Republic, which they were no longer
                        able to govern. It was, as has been already remarked<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a>, to this class among the Romans, almost exclusively,
                        that the taste for literature was confined in the last age of the Republic;
                        and it was among men of this class, such as the Luculli and Hortensius, and
                        the Velleius and Torquatus of Cicero’s Dialogues, that the Epicurean
                        philosophy found its chief adherents. The poem of Lucretius shows all the
                        courage and energy, the power of command, the sense of superiority and the
                        direct simplicity of manner emanating from it, which are the inheritance of
                        a great governing class. He is the one man of true genius for poetry whom
                        that class gave to Rome. His lofty pathos and tenderness of feeling are the
                        graces of his own nature, refined and purified by the most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>humanising studies. His profound melancholy is a
                        mood natural to one who looks on the passing away of a great order of
                        things, political, social, and religious, in the midst of scenes of
                        turbulence and violence, and takes refuge from an alien world in the
                        contemplation of another order of things, infinitely more majestic than
                        either the old social state which was shaken and tottering to its fall, or
                        the new which was yet ‘powerless to be born.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There could scarcely be any greater contrast, in social relations and the
                        dispositions arising out of them, between any two men, than between the
                        representative of the old governing families of the Republic, and the
                        humbly-born native of the Cisalpine province,—delicate in health, modest
                        and self-distrustful, yet endowed with a deep consciousness of genius and a
                        resolution to follow that guidance only,—entering on manhood and beginning
                        his career as poet contemporaneously with the events which determined the
                        ascendency of the new order of things, and identified with it through his
                        personal relations to the leading men of the new Empire,—a poet who derived
                        from his birth and early nurture ‘the spirit of the ages of Faith<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a>,’—one too who had been
                        happy in his early home-affections and in the friendships of his manhood,
                        and who was able to dedicate his mature years to his art under conditions of
                        the greatest personal and national security. In considering the influence of
                        the ideas of Lucretius on the mind of Virgil, we must accordingly make large
                        allowance for the medium of alien sympathies, personal, social, and
                        political, through which they were refracted. We must take into
                        consideration also the wide difference between the philosophic poet and the
                        pure poetic artist. The feeling of Virgil towards philosophy was apparently
                        one of aspiration rather than of possession. He shows no interest in the
                        processes of enquiry,—in tracing the operation of great laws in manifold
                        phenomena,—in investigating one obscure subject after another, with the
                        confident assurance that every discovery <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is
                        a step towards the light and the ultimate revelation of the whole mystery.

                        Nature. He receives and applies the complete ideas of Lucretius, but he does
                        not follow them with the eagerness of their author through the various
                        phases of their development. Certain results of a philosophic system affect
                        his imagination, but he does not seem to feel how these results necessarily
                        exclude other conclusions which he will not abandon. Hence arises his
                        prevailing eclecticism,—the existence of popular beliefs side by side in
                        his mind with the tenets of Epicureans, Stoics, and Platonists,—of some
                        conclusions of the Lucretian science along with the opposing doctrines
                        expressed in the poetry of Alexandria. Even in the arrangement of his
                        materials and the grouping of his landscapes, some chance association or
                        rhythmical cadence seems to guide his hand, more often than the perception
                        of the orderly connexion of phenomena with one another. </p>

                        than any previous poet or philosopher, was the idea of Nature, apprehended,
                        not as an abstract conception, but as a power omnipresent, creative, and
                        regulative throughout the great spheres of earth, sky, and sea, and the
                        innumerable varieties of individual existence. The meaning conveyed by the

                        Empedocles, etc., is powerless to move the imagination or enlarge the sense
                        of beauty, when compared with the illimitable content of ‘Natura daedala
                        rerum’ as conceived by the Latin poet. Nature is to him the one power
                        absolutely supreme and independent in the Universe, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>too vast and too manifold to be subject to any will but her

                        beings, of limited power and intelligence, which the old mythologies
                        established as lords over the world and man. The gods, abiding in a state of
                        blessed ease and indifference, are themselves dependent on a power
                        infinitely transcending their own. But in what relation does man stand to
                        this power? He too is within her sphere, altogether subject to her, but no
                        special object of her regard. He exists only through compliance with and
                        resignation to her conditions. And these conditions are on the whole
                        unfavourable to him. He can gain only a scanty subsistence by a continual
                        struggle with reluctant and rebellious forces in the earth; and even after

                        struggle which man is forced to carry on with an unsympathetic Power—sank
                        into the mind of Virgil, is evident from the various passages in the
                        Georgics in which the phraseology as well as the idea expressed by Lucretius
                        is reproduced. These lines in which the struggle between the ‘vis humana’
                        impersonated in the husbandman, and the resistance offered by Nature to his
                        energetic labours, is vividly described, suggest whatever there is of
                        speculative thought in the Georgics. And though it would be misleading to
                        speak of that poem as, in any sense, a philosophical poem, yet, as in all
                        other great works of genius, some theory of life—of man’s relation to his
                        circumstances and of his place, either in a spiritual or natural
                        dispensation—pervades and gives its highest meaning to the didactic

                        and sky<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a>. </p>

                        Lucretius has no other answer to give him than to study the laws of Nature,
                        so as to understand his position, and thus to limit his wants and reconcile
                        himself to what he cannot alter. Yet in other passages of the poem, which
                        Virgil also remembered<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a>, he did
                        recognise the fact that human skill and the knowledge acquired by
                        observation had done much to enrich and beautify the earth:— </p>

                        with imaginative sympathy the trials of the ‘grandis arator’ and the
                        ‘vetulae vitis sator,’ he has no guidance to offer them. The lessons taught
                        by Lucretius are not those of active energy, applicable to every condition
                        of life, but the lessons of a resigned quietism and a contemplative energy,
                        adapted only to men of leisure, enjoying ample resources for the
                        gratification of their intellectual tastes. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That this opinion of the decay in the natural productiveness of the earth
                        made a strong impression on the Roman mind may be inferred from the fact
                        that Columella opens his treatise by arguing against it. And that the idea
                        of the struggle with Nature was one familiar to the prose writers on such
                        subjects appears from an expression in the first book of the same writer:
                        ‘that the land ought to be weaker than the husbandman, since he has to
                        struggle with it.’ Cicero too puts into Cato’s <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mouth<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> the
                        sentiment that the earth, if rightly dealt with, never refuses the
                        ‘imperium’ of man. And this too is Virgil’s doctrine: and it was to give
                        that guidance which Lucretius, though he discerned the evil, did not supply,
                        that the didactic directions of the Georgics were given. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Lucretian idea of Nature, both in its philosophical and poetical
                        significance, runs through the Georgics; but it is modified by other
                        considerations, and it is rather latent than prominent in the poetry and in
                        the practical teaching of the poem. The mind of Virgil is not possessed, as
                        the mind of Lucretius was possessed, by the thought of the immensity of her
                        sphere and the universality of her presence. He sees her presence in the
                        familiar scenes and objects around him. The idea adds variety, grace, and
                        liveliness to his description of every detail of rural industry. A sense of
                        the ministering agency of Nature is a more pervading element in his poetry
                        than that of her power and majesty. Objects are still regarded by him as
                        separate and individual. The conceptions of Nature which created mythology
                        contend in his mind with the half-apprehended conceptions of universal law
                        and of the interdependence of phenomena on one another. Thus the poetical
                        element in his descriptions of the life of plants and trees, or of the
                        forces of flood and storm, does not spring from such deep sources in the
                        imagination as the same element in the descriptions of the older poet. But
                        neither is it limited to the perception of the ‘outward shows’ of things
                        which gratify the eye, or the sounds which delight the ear. Even in the
                        Eclogues the intuition into Nature is deeper than that. The study of
                        Lucretius has enriched the Georgics with the most pervading charm of the
                        poem—the sense of a secret, unceasing, tranquil power (like that ascribed
                        by Wordsworth to May— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the Lucretian conception of Nature in its relation to human wants has
                        been greatly modified by the religious tendency of Virgil’s thought, his
                        respect for traditional opinion, his sense of man’s dependence on a higher
                        Spiritual Power. Nature he regards as no more independent in her sphere than
                        man is in his. The laws and conditions imposed on her have been appointed
                        with reference to the relation in which she stands to man. Where these
                        conditions are unfavourable, they have been appointed to quicken man’s
                        faculties and force him into the ways of industry. Lucretius dwells on the
                        fact that two-thirds of our globe are unsuited for human habitation, as
                        disproving the opinion of a Divine creation of the world for the benefit of
                            man<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>: Virgil dwells on the fact
                        that two temperate regions have been assigned to weak mortals as a proof of
                        Divine beneficence<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a>. Virgil also
                        accepts the idea that the earth once was more productive than it is<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>, but he accepts it in the spirit of Hesiod
                        rather than of Lucretius. In the Golden Age, under Saturn, the earth bore
                        all things spontaneously. It was Jove—or Providence—who imposed on man,
                        and continues to impose on him, the necessity of labouring for his
                        subsistence; and this he did, not, as Hesiod believed, in anger at the
                        deceit of Prometheus, but as a discipline and incentive to exertion. The
                        poetical references to the Saturnian Age and the subsequent reign of Jove
                        need not imply a literal belief in the fables of mythology, any more than
                        the allusion at Georg. i. 62 to the fable of Pyrrha and Deucalion implies
                        the literal acceptance of the explanation there given of the existence of
                        the present race of men. But as that allusion seems meant to convey the
                        belief in a Divine creative act, so the former allusion seems to convey a
                        belief in a Divine moral dispensation. The idea of Providential guidance, of
                        a Supreme Father, wielding the forces of Nature, shaping the destinies of
                        man, acting for the most part by regular processes in order <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that man may learn to understand his ways<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>, but making his personal agency more manifest from time to
                        time, as after the death of Caesar, by signs and wonders interrupting the
                        order of Nature, supersedes or largely modifies the conception of natural
                        law. The other powers of the Greek Olympus and of the Roman Pantheon are no
                        longer, as the former are in the Iliad, at war with one another, but all
                        work in harmony with the Supreme Will. Like the fables just referred to, the
                        names of these deities seem to be introduced symbolically, to signify the
                        different modes of activity of the one Supreme Spiritual Power, and the
                        different forms under which he is to be reverenced. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The speculative idea of the Georgics is thus rather a theological than a
                        philosophical idea. The ultimate fact which Virgil endeavours to set forth
                        and justify is the relation of man to Nature, under a Divine dispensation.
                        He too, as well as Lucretius, recognises the tendency of all things to
                        degenerate; but this tendency he attributes, not to natural loss of force,
                        but to the fiat of Omnipotence— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He too recognises the liability to failure and loss from causes over which
                        man has no direct control,—the violence of storms, the inclemency of
                        seasons, etc.,—as well as from others which he is able to provide against
                        by constant vigilance. What resource has he against these untoward
                        conditions? First he is bound to watch the signs of impending change which
                        Providence has appointed, so as to leave as little as possible at the mercy
                        of the elements. Next he has the resource of prayer, and the power of
                        propitiating Heaven by customary rites and sacrifices, and by a life of
                        piety and innocence. The ethical precepts of the poem, as is said by a
                        distinguished French <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>writer, may be summed
                        up in the medieval maxim, ‘Laborare est orare<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To inculcate the necessity of a constant struggle with the reluctant forces
                        of Nature, and to show how this struggle may be successfully conducted by
                        incessant labour, vigilance, propitiation of the Supreme Will by prayer and
                        piety, thus appears to be the main ethical teaching of the Georgics. And
                        this statement of Virgil’s aim is not inconsistent with the interpretation
                        of his meaning, first suggested by Mr. Merivale, and accepted and admirably
                        illustrated by Conington. But the phrase ‘glorification of labour’ suggests
                        modern rather than ancient associations. Labour is not glorified as an end
                        in itself; it is inculcated as a duty, as the condition appointed by
                        Providence for attaining the peace, abundance, happiness, and worth of the
                        life of the fields. As of old </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> so now they make the sweat of man’s brow the means through which the ‘divini
                        gloria ruris’ can be realised. By the labour spent in drawing into actual
                        existence the glory and beauty of the land man best fulfils his duty and
                        secures his happiness. There is no truer source for him of material and
                        moral good, of simple pleasures, of contemplative delight. Yet if we wish
                        rightly to appreciate the purely didactic parts of the poem, it is
                        impossible, as has been fully shown by Conington in his General Introduction
                        to the Georgics, to overrate the stress which Virgil puts on the ceaseless
                        industry, foresight, vigilance, and actual force<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> which must be put forth by the husbandman, as the condition
                        of success in the struggle in which he is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>engaged. The very style of the Georgics bears the impress of this
                        predominant idea. It is this idea which seems to give Roman strength to the
                        workmanship of the poem; as it is the sense of the rich and tender life of
                        Nature which gives to it the softness of Italian sentiment, so marvellously
                        blended with that Roman strength. The imperial tone of conquest and command
                        and civilising influence makes itself heard in such lines as these:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This idea of the need of a struggle with Nature, latent under all the
                        special precepts of the Georgics, is thus seen to arise out of the
                        philosophical thought of Lucretius. But the lesson inculcated by Virgil is
                        directly opposite to that state of quietism and pure contemplation in which
                        Lucretius finds the ideal of human life. Virgil’s teaching is that best
                        adapted to the strenuous temperament of his countrymen and to the general
                        condition of men in all times. And it will be found that this idea of a hard
                        struggle, ordained by Supreme Power, against adverse circumstances, in which
                        man receives Divine guidance by prayer and patient interpretation of the
                        will of Heaven, and through which he attains to a state of final rest, runs
                        through the Aeneid as well as the Georgics. Virgil reaches a practical
                        result opposed to that which Lucretius reaches, by subordinating the
                        Lucretian conception of man’s relation to Nature to the Platonic belief in
                        the supremacy of a Spiritual Will and in the moral dispensation under which
                        man is placed. It is this belief which appears to underlie Virgil’s
                        acceptance of the religious traditions of antiquity, which might have been
                        expected to have received, for all educated minds, their death-blow at the
                        hands of Lucretius. </p>

                        imagination, without caring for their consistency with others which he
                        equally accepts. There is a constant tendency in him to allow his belief in
                        the miraculous to interfere with his belief in natural law; as for instance
                        in the account he gives of the birth of bees (iv. 200), and again of their
                        spontaneous generation from the blood of slain bullocks (iv. 285). He has
                        not the firm faith in natural agency which Lucretius had. Phenomena are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>still regarded by him as isolated, not
                        interdependent. The ordinary course of Nature he supposes to be interrupted
                        by marvels and portents. The signs of coming things are represented, not as
                        Lucretius would have represented them, as natural antecedents or

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For the technical execution of his poem Virgil could gain little help from
                        his Greek models. The mass of materials which he had to reduce to order was
                        much larger and more miscellaneous than the special topics selected for
                        their art by the Alexandrians. The subject treated in the Georgics would
                        have afforded scope for several poems treated on the principle on which
                        Aratus and Nicander treated their subjects; and not only was the mass of
                        materials larger and more varied, but the whole purpose of the Georgics was
                        more complex. Virgil’s artistic aim was not only to combine into one work
                        the topics which he treats successively in the four books of the Georgics,
                        but to interweave with them the poetry of personal and national feeling, of
                        speculative ideas, of ethical and religious teaching, of science, of the
                        living world of Nature. In Lucretius, on the other hand, he found an example
                        of the systematic treatment of a vaster range of topics,—a range so vast,
                        indeed, that the principal topics of Virgil’s art enter as subsidiary
                        elements into one part of his representation. Lucretius too had shown how to
                        combine with the systematic exposition of his abstract theme a strong
                        personal interest and a strong ethical purpose. He had shown how, out of the
                        treatment of this abstract theme, opportunities naturally arose for uttering
                        the poetry and pathos of human life, and for delineating in all its beauty
                        and majesty the outward face and revealing the inner secret of Nature. He
                        thus supplied the general plan which Virgil might follow, with modifications
                        suited to his narrower range of subject and his more purely didactic office.
                        We see how Virgil adopts this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>plan,
                        modified to suit his own ideas, in the personal dedication; in the
                        Invocation and short introduction to his various books; in his manner of
                        arranging, connecting, and illustrating the successive stages of his
                        exposition; and, lastly, in the use which he makes of episodes, chiefly at
                        the end of various books, with the view of enabling his readers to feel the
                        intimate connexion of his subject with the most valued interests of
                        life,—with religion and morality, with family affection, with peace,
                        prosperity, and national greatness. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The first parallel to be noticed, in the comparison between the two poems,
                        is in the personal address. Maecenas stands in the same relation to the
                        Georgics as Memmius does to the ‘De Rerum Natura.’ But as Memmius in the
                        body of the poem is often merged in the ideal philosophical student, so
                        Virgil, after the lines of compliment at the opening of his various books,
                        for the most part directs his instructions to some imaginary husbandman. In
                        the tones in which Memmius and Maecenas are respectively addressed there may
                        be an equal sincerity of feeling. But a difference in the relation in which
                        the poets stand to those whom they address makes itself felt in the contrast
                        between such lines as these, </p>

                        friendship. In the other case, though the affection may not be less sincere,
                        there is the unmistakeable note of deference to a social superior. </p>

                        of their reverential homage. Though the poem of Lucretius is inscribed to
                        Memmius, it is really dedicated to the glory of Epicurus. His image presides
                        over the massive temple raised to the Power of Nature. He is the great
                        benefactor of the world, exalted by his service to mankind, not only above
                        all living men, but above those whom the popular religion had in early times
                        elevated to the rank of gods— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But it is in their invocations of a Superior Power to aid them in their task
                        that we recognise the strongest contrast between the philosophic poet, who,
                        while denying all supernatural agency, is yet carried away by his
                        imagination to attribute consciousness, will, and passion to the great
                        creative Power of Nature,—the source of all life, joy, beauty, and
                        art,—and the ‘pius vates,’ influenced by the religious sense of man’s
                        dependence on a Spiritual Power, deeply feeling the poetical charm of the
                        old mythology, and striving to effect some reconcilement between the fading
                        traditions of Polytheism and the more philosophical conceptions prevalent in
                        his time. Lucretius for the moment adopts the symbolism of ancient
                        mythology, and probably the actual figures of pictorial art (which elsewhere
                        he speaks of as a great source of human delusion), to impart visible
                        presence, colour, and passion to his thought; but he leaves no doubt on the
                        reader’s mind that his representation is merely symbolical. Virgil, on the
                        other hand, appears in the opening lines of the Georgics to attribute a
                        distinct personality to the beings of that composite Polytheism which had
                        gradually grown up out of the union of Greek art and Roman religion, but
                        which it is difficult to comprehend as having any real hold over the minds
                        of men who had received any tincture of Greek philosophy. In the divine
                        office which he assigns to Caesar he adopts the latest addition to this
                        eclectic Pantheon; and this new divinity he introduces in the midst of the
                        old gods, just as he fancifully introduces Gallus in the Eclogues amid the
                        choir of Apollo and the Muses. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But in the Eclogues there is no feeling of doubt in our minds that the
                        representation is purely fanciful. The strain in the Georgics is altogether
                        too serious; the juxtaposition of Caesar with the gods of Olympus and the
                        protecting deities of the husbandman is too carefully meditated to admit of
                        our supposing the lines from ‘Tuque adeo’ to ‘adsuesce vocari’ to be
                        intended to be taken as a mere play of fancy. We cannot <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>think of Lucretius, perhaps not even of Cicero, reading
                        Virgil’s Invocation, and especially the concluding lines of it, without a
                        certain feeling of scorn. We cannot help asking how far could the pupil of
                        Siron, the student of Epicurus and Lucretius, the enlightened associate of
                        Maecenas, Augustus, Pollio, Horace, etc., attach any serious meaning to the
                        words of this Invocation. How far was he simply complying with an
                        established convention of literature? how far using these mythological
                        representations as symbolism? how far was he identifying himself in
                        imagination with the beliefs of his ideal husbandman? </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To answer these questions we must endeavour to realise the very composite
                        character which the Pagan religion, the accumulation of many beliefs from
                        the earliest and rudest fancies of primitive times to the studied
                        representations of Greek art and the later symbolical explanations of
                        philosophical schools, presented to men living in the Augustan Age. In this
                        Invocation and in the body of the poem we can trace three or four distinct
                        veins of belief, existing together, without producing any sense of
                        inconsistency, and combining into a certain unity for the purpose of
                        artistic representation. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Religion in the Augustan Age presented a different aspect to the dwellers in
                        the town and in the country; to the refined classes whose tastes were formed
                        by Greek art and poetry, and to men of the old school,—senators like Cotta
                        or antiquarians like Varro,—who sought to conform to the ancient Roman
                        traditions; to students of philosophy, who either, like the Epicureans,
                        denied all Divine agency, or like the Stoics, resolved the many divinities
                        of the popular belief into one Divine agency under many forms. The
                        peculiarity of Virgil’s mind is that his belief, at least as expressed in
                        his poetry, was a kind of syncretism composed out of all these modes of
                        thought and belief. Like Horace and Tibullus, he sympathises in imagination
                        with that rustic piety which expressed the natural thankfulness of the human
                        heart for protection afforded to the flocks and the fruits of the field, by
                        festivals and ceremonial observances like the Palilia and Ambarvalia, by
                        sacrifice of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kid to Faunus, or offerings
                        of flowers and fruit to the Penates. The feelings connected with this vein

                        the peasants among whom they lived enhanced the real enjoyment derived from
                        their country life by men of refined feeling like Horace and Tibullus. But
                        Virgil’s feeling in regard to the religious trust and observances of the
                        country people appears to be stronger than mere poetical sympathy. He sees
                        in them a class of men more immediately dependent than others on the
                        protection of some unseen Power, and thus forced, as it were, into more
                        immediate relation with that Power. The modes in which they endeavoured to
                        gain the favour of that Power or to express their thankfulness for its
                        protection were probably among the influences which had moulded his own

                        Lycaeus, just as Horace describes him as passing nimbly from his Arcadian
                        haunt to the Sabine Lucretilis. These gods, nymphs, and satyrs of an alien
                        belief were now to Romans as to Greeks the recognised materials which art
                        and song had to shape into new forms. In the vigorous prime of Greek poetry,
                        so late even as the age of Sophocles and Herodotus, there was a real belief
                        in the personal existence and active agency of these supernatural beings.
                        This real belief first gave birth to, and was afterwards merged in, the
                        representations of art. Art, which owed its birth to religious sentiment,
                        superseded it. But after a time and under new conditions the strong
                        admiration for the beauty or significance of the objects represented in art
                        produces a strong wish to revive the belief in their reality; and in minds
                        peculiarly susceptible of such influences the wish tends to fulfil itself. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Probably Virgil himself would not have cared to probe too deeply the state
                        of half-belief in which his heart and mind realised the bright existence and
                        kindly influence of beings consecrated to him by the most cherished
                        associations of living art and the poetry of the past. Even Lucretius, while
                        sternly rejecting all belief in their existence as absolutely incompatible
                        with truth, feels from time to time attracted by their poetical charm.
                        Horace, we can see, from the absence of anything in his Satires, or
                        Epistles, implying a real belief in the gods of mythology, keeps his
                        literary belief apart from his true convic<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tions. In the case of Virgil, it is not possible, at all events for a
                        modern reader, distinctly to separate them. The power of the old mythology
                        over the fancy and the weakness of scientific thought in ancient times to
                        overthrow that power is nowhere more visible than in his poetry. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there was another mode of Greek influence acting on the educated minds
                        of Rome, stronger than that of the ancient mythology. That influence was the
                        religious speculations of the various philosophical schools<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>. There was, on the one hand, the Epicurean acceptance of an
                        infinite number of gods dwelling in the ‘Intermundia,’ enjoying a state of
                        supreme calm, apart from all concern with this world or the labours and
                        pursuits of men. They might be objects of pure contemplation, and pious
                        reverence to the human spirit; but they were capable neither of being
                        propitiated nor made angry by anything that men could do. The Stoic
                        doctrine, on the other hand, recognised the incessant agency and forethought
                        of a Supreme Spiritual Power over human life. It accepted the stories and
                        beings of the traditional religion, but explained them away. The various
                        deities worshipped by the people are the various manifestations and
                        functions of this one Supreme Spiritual Power, whether called by the name of
                        Zeus, or by the abstract name of Providence (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">πρόνοια</span></span>). This is the
                        Power addressed in the famous hymn of Cleanthes, and that appealed to in the
                        familiar <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν</span></span> of Aratus. It is part of Virgil’s
                        eclecticism to combine the science of Epicurus with the theology of the more
                        spiritual schools. The Supreme Spiritual Power in the Georgics is generally
                        spoken of under the title of ‘Pater.’ It is noticeable that the word
                        Iuppiter is used either with a purely physical signification, as in </p>

                        theology was recognised in ancient times in the identification of the sun
                        and moon—‘clarissima mundi lumina’—with Liber and Ceres<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a>. The
                        rhythm of the lines 5–7 can leave no doubt whatever as to this
                        identification, notwithstanding the appeal to Varro’s example, who
                        distinguishes the various deities whom he invokes. It is characteristic of
                        Virgil’s art to introduce such a variation in any passage which he imitates,
                        and also to suggest a thought which he does not distinctly develope. In the

                        picture of the harvest-moon looking down on the corn-fields of the

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The national religion of Rome was something distinct both from the rustic
                        Paganism of Italy, and from that aesthetic amalgamation of Greek and Roman
                        beliefs and that semi-philosophical rationalism which art and literature
                        made familiar to the Romans of the Augustan Age. The great symbol of that
                        national religion was the Temple of Jove on the Capitol<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a>. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That religion was based on the idea that the wide empire and eternal
                        duration of Rome had been appointed by Divine decree. As distinguished from
                        the national religion of Greece, which expressed itself in new and varied
                        forms of art, Roman religion was one which adhered to ancient rites and
                        expressed itself in the pomp of outward ceremonial and other impressive
                        symbols. It acted on the imagination through the sense of vastness, pomp,
                        stateliness, and solemnity; that of Greece through the sense of life, joy,
                        beauty, and harmony animating its ceremonial and embodying itself in its
                        symbols. The objects of Roman worship were almost innumerable. In addition
                        to the greater divinities which it shared with the Greek worship, and
                        besides the various native divinities common to it with the religion of
                        other Italian races, Roman religion had erected temples to various abstract
                        qualities, such as Peace, Faith, Concord, and the like. This tendency to
                        multiply their deities, to deify mere abstractions, and to recognise a
                        distinct deity as presiding over every common act and process of life,
                        weakened or destroyed the sense of the personality of the gods, and thus
                        indirectly promoted that advance to Monotheism which philosophy had made in
                        a different direction. While the Greeks conceived of each local god or hero
                        as a distinct person, endowed with his own human qualities and his own
                        visible shape, and thus naturally adapted for the representations of
                        dramatic poetry or plastic art, the Romans worshipped rather one Divine
                        impersonal power with many attributes and functions. The need which the
                        popular imagination feels of some personal embodiment of the idea of Godhead
                        probably explains the readiness with which, in the dissolution of older
                        faiths, the worship of the Emperor became the chief symbol of the national
                        faith. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So far as the conceptions of the national religion of Rome, which have a
                        powerful influence on the action of the Aeneid, enter into this Invocation,
                        it is in the recognition of the divinity of Caesar. But here he is
                        associated with the rural gods, who listen to the prayers of the husbandman,
                        rather than, as elsewhere both in Horace and Virgil, with the majesty of the
                        Roman State. The passage probably, as is suggested by Ribbeck, owes its
                        origin to the decree of the Senate in 36 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>,—after the naval victory gained by Agrippa over Sextus
                        Pompeius,—by which the worship of Caesar, ‘inter municipales deos,’ was
                        established. There is probably no passage in Virgil, scarcely any in Latin
                        poetry, which must strike the modern reader as so unreal as this, or so
                        untrue to the actual convictions of educated men. There is none in which the
                        language of adulation appears so palpably, or in which the love of
                        mythological allusion, as one of the conventional ornaments of poetry,
                        appears to exercise so unfortunate an influence on the truthful feeling of
                        the poet. It seems strange that a man of the commanding understanding of
                        Augustus should have derived any pleasure from the supposition that he might
                        become the son-in-law of Tethys, from the statement that the glowing
                        Scorpion was already beginning to make room for him in the sky, or from the
                        appeal made to him to resist the ambition of supplanting Pluto as the future
                        ruler of Tartarus. In contrast with this state of feeling we learn to
                        respect the masculine sense and dignity with which Tiberius disclaims the
                        attribution of divine honours: ‘I, Conscript Fathers, call you to witness
                        and desire posterity to remember, that I am but a mortal, and am performing
                        human duties, and consider it enough if I fill the foremost place<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>.’ But though it is not possible
                        that the lines from ‘Tuque adeo’ to ‘adsuesce vocari’ should ever appear
                        natural to us, or that we should ever read them without some feeling that
                        they are unworthy of the manliness of a great poet, we may yet recognise
                        some symbolical meaning in them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beyond the
                        mere expression of overstrained eulogy. In such expressions as </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil associates the idea of the power of Caesar with the main subject of
                        his poem; and probably, as is pointed out by Ribbeck, he suggests the
                        thought of the dependence of Rome and Italy for subsistence on the vigilance
                        of their ruler<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>. In the mention of Tethys there is a reference to recent
                        naval successes; and in the ‘tibi serviat ultima Thule’ there may be an
                        allusion to the contemplated expedition to Britain, and certainly, as in so
                        many other passages of the poetry of the age, there is a recognition of the
                        wide empire of Rome. In the lines </p>

                        neopaganism of art,—it is difficult to say how far we are to recognise the
                        representations of fiction, conscious that it is fiction, as in the
                        mythological art of the Renaissance, or how far we are in the presence of a
                        temporary revival of a faith which satisfied a simpler time, in inconsistent
                        conjunction with incompatible modes of modern thought. Probably not even the
                        poets themselves, and least of all Virgil, could have given an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>explanation of their real state of mind. The
                        dreams of an older faith were still haunting them, though its substance was
                        gone. The traditions of the Greek mythology survived, endowed with what, in
                        the absence of any new creed, might seem immortal life, in the pages of
                        poets, and in the paintings and other works of art which afforded a refined
                        pleasure to educated men. The national faith of Italy and Rome still kept
                        the outward show of life in many visible symbols, and still retained a hold
                        over the mass of the people. The herds and flocks were still believed to
                        flourish under the kindly protection of Pales and Faunus. The festive
                        pleasures of country life at the harvest-home or the vintage season were
                        enjoyed on old religious holidays, and formed part of ceremonies handed down
                        from immemorial antiquity. The pomp and ceremonial of what was peculiarly
                        the Roman worship still met the eye on all great occasions within the walls
                        of the city:— </p>

                        gods with those of the gods of Olympus seemed to preside over the tumult and
                        active business of the Forum; and the majesty of the Capitoline Jove was
                        still recognised as the manifestation of the stability and power of the
                        State. But the Roman imagination was at the same time beginning to be
                        impressed by a new symbol of Divine agency, which was felt in all national
                        concerns. The ideal majesty of Jove was merging, as an object of veneration,
                        in the actual majesty of Caesar, regarded as the vicegerent of the Supreme
                        Power. All these phases of religious belief, Greek and Italian, old and new,
                        some appealing to the popular, some to the educated mind, meet in the poetry
                        of the Augustan Age, and nowhere in more close conjunction than in this

                        connexion with the later results of science and philosophic thought. It is

                        their proper place in the reasonable intelligence of the age may be assigned
                        to each. They came together in Virgil as a composite result of the union of
                        his literary and philosophic tastes with his religious feeling and national
                        sympathies. So far as we can attach any truth of meaning to this Invocation,
                        we must look upon it as a symbolical expression of Divine agency and
                        superintendence in all the various fields of natural production. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil is much more sparing than Lucretius in the proems to his other books.
                        In the second book there is a brief invocation to Liber, who is introduced,
                        with rich pictorial colouring, as the special god of the vintage; and at
                        lines 39–46 there is an appeal to Maecenas, which disclaims, perhaps not
                        without some reference to the contrary practice of Lucretius, all intention
                        to detain his hearer ‘through digressions from the main theme and long
                        preambles.’ In the fourth there is again a brief appeal to Maecenas, a
                        statement of the subject, an admission of its homely character,—‘In tenui
                        labor,’—an expression of the hope that, even out of these materials, great
                        glory may ensue if Apollo hears the poet’s prayer and no unpropitious powers
                        impede the course of his song. The introduction to the third book is more
                        extended, and more interesting from the light which it throws on the motives
                        which determined Virgil to the choice of the subject of his epic poem. Here,
                        too, as in the first and second books, there is an appeal to the tutelary
                        deities of the herds and flocks, the Italian Pales, and the ‘Pastor ab
                        Amphryso,’—the Apollo <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">νόμιος</span></span> of Greek legend and rural worship.
                        The associations of Greek poetry are also evoked in the reference to the
                        woods and streams of Lycaeus, to the lowing herds of Cithaeron, to the dogs
                        that range over Taygetus, and to the famous horses of the Argive plain. The
                        choice of the subject is justified by the contrast suggested between its
                        novelty—‘silvas saltusque sequamur Intactos’—and the hackneyed poems
                        founded on mythological subjects which his immediate predecessors in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>poetry had written in imitation of their
                        Alexandrine prototypes. But he indicates here, with a new application of the
                        words of Ennius, the aspiration to compose a great national epic in
                        celebration of the exploits of Caesar:— </p>

                        making contemporary events subsidiary and the ancient legend the main

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As affecting the arrangement and illustration of their materials, there is
                        this essential difference between the poems of Lucretius and Virgil, that
                        the one is a great continuous argument, the development of speculative
                        truths depending on one another; and its professed aim is purely
                        contemplative,—the production of a certain state of mind and feeling. The
                        other is the orderly exposition of a number of precepts, depending on
                        experience and special knowledge; its professed aim is the mastery over a
                        great practical occupation. Lucretius uses poetry as the vehicle of science,
                        Virgil as the instrument of a useful art. In the first we expect, and we
                        find, in so far as the poem was left completed, rigorous concentration of
                        thought, and an exhaustive treatment of the subject. In the second we
                        expect, and we find, an orderly and convenient arrangement, and such a
                        selection of topics as, while producing the impression of a thorough mastery
                        of the subject, leaves also much to be filled up by the imagination or
                        experience of the reader. Still, that Virgil regarded Lucretius as his
                        technical model may be inferred from the use which he makes of several of
                        his formulae, such as ‘Principio,’ ‘Quod superest,’ ‘His animadversis,’
                        ‘Nunc age,’ ‘Praeterea,’ by which the framework of his argument is held
                        together. Virgil uses these more sparingly, and with a more careful
                        selection, so as, while producing the impression of continuity of thought,
                        not to impede the pure flow of his poetry with the mechanism of logical
                        connexion. He follows Lucretius also, who here observed the practice of the
                        Greek didactic poets, in maintaining the liveliness of a personal address by
                        the frequent use of such appeals as these, ‘Nonne vides,’ ‘Contemplator,’
                        ‘Forsitan et ... quaeras,’ ‘Vidi,’ ‘Ausim,’ etc. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In illustrating and giving novelty to his various topics Virgil has the
                        example of Lucretius to justify him in catching up and dwelling on every
                        aspect of beauty or imaginative interest which they are capable of
                        presenting. And it is here that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more
                        careful art of Virgil, and the fact that he attached more value to the
                        perfection of his art than to the knowledge he imparts, give him that
                        technical superiority over the older writer which, notwithstanding the tamer
                        interest of his subject, and perhaps the tamer character of his own genius,
                        has made the Georgics a poem much more familiar to the world than the ‘De
                        Rerum Natura.’ Virgil, for one thing, enjoys greater freedom of omitting any
                        set of topics,—any of those details on which Cato or Varro would have felt
                        themselves bound to be specially explicit,—which would detract unduly from
                        the beauty and general amenity of his exposition; or by a simple touch (such
                        as the ‘Ne saturare fimo pingui,’ etc.) he can suggest the necessity of
                        attending to such topics, while leaving their full realisation to the
                        reader. He thus, by greater selection and elimination of his materials,
                        avoids the monotony and the long prosaic interspaces between the grander
                        bursts of poetry which his vast argument imposes on Lucretius. But, further,
                        he avails himself of many more resources to give variety of interest and
                        literary charm to the topics which he successively deals with. Each and all
                        of these topics,—the processes of ploughing and sowing, the signs of the
                        weather, the grafting of trees and the pruning of the vine, the qualities of
                        horses and cattle, the tending of sheep and goats, the observation of the
                        habits of bees,—bring him into immediate contact with the genial influences
                        of the outward world. The vastness as well as the abstract character of his
                        subject forces Lucretius to pass through many regions which seem equally
                        removed from this genial presence and from all human associations. It is
                        only the enthusiasm of discovery—the delight in purely intellectual
                        processes—that bears him buoyantly through these dreary spaces; and it is
                        only the knowledge that from time to time glimpses of illimitable power and
                        wonder are opened up to him, and admiration for the energy and clear vision
                        of his guide, that compel the flagging reader to accompany him. But Virgil
                        leads his readers through scenes, tamer indeed and more familiar, yet always
                        bright and smiling with some homely charm, or rich and glowing with the
                        ‘pomp <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of cultivated nature,’ or fresh and
                        picturesque with the charm of meadow, river-bank, or woodland pasture. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The secret of the power of Lucretius as an interpreter of Nature lies in his
                        recognition of the sublimity of natural law in ordinary phenomena. The
                        secret of Virgil’s power lies in the insight and long-practised meditation
                        through which he abstracts the single element of beauty from common sights
                        and the ordinary operations of industry. Thus, to take one or two instances
                        of the way in which the charm of Nature is communicated to the drudgery of
                        rural labour:—what a sense of refreshment to eye and ear is conveyed by the
                        lines which describe the practical remedies by which the farmer mitigates
                        the burning drought of summer:— </p>

                        of man. The perception of analogy originates in the philosophical and
                        imaginative thought of Lucretius; and it is in the second Book, in the
                        composition of which, as Mr. Munro has shown, Virgil’s mind was saturated
                        with the ideas, feelings, and language of his predecessor, that this element
                        of poetical interest is most conspicuous. The following examples, occurring

                        the epithets applied to material objects, such as ‘ignava,’ ‘laeta et
                        fortia,’ ‘maligni,’ ‘infelix,’ etc., consists in the suggestion of a kind of
                        personal life underlying and animating the silent processes of Nature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil, too, like Lucretius, shows the close observation of a naturalist,
                        and a genuine sympathy with the pains and pleasures of all living things,
                        especially of the animals associated with the toil or amusement of men. The
                        interest of the third Book arises, to a great degree, from the truth and
                        vivacity of feeling with which he observes and identifies himself with the
                        ways and dispositions of these fellow-labourers of man,—with the pride and
                        emulation of the horse, the fidelity and companionship of the dog, the
                        combative courage of the bull and his sense of pain and dishonour in defeat,
                        the patience of the steer and his brotherly feeling for his yoke-fellow in
                        toil, and with the attachment of sheep and goats to their offspring and to
                        their familiar haunts<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a>. The interest of the fourth Book, again, turns on the
                        analogy implied between the pursuits, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fortunes, wars, and state-policy of bee-communities and of men. It is the
                        sense of this analogy that imparts a meaning deeper than that demanded by
                        the obvious force of the words—a more pathetic feeling of the vanity of all
                        earthly strife—to that final touch in the description of the combat in
                        mid-air between two hosts, led by rival chiefs:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In thus relieving the dryness of technical detail, by availing himself of
                        every aspect of beauty associated with it, and by imparting the vivacity of
                        human relations and sensibility to natural objects, Virgil makes use of the
                        same resources as elicit springs of poetic feeling from many of the dry and
                        stony wastes through which the argument of Lucretius leads him. There are
                        others however employed by Virgil, which Lucretius uses more sparingly or
                        not at all. There are, in the first place, all those which arise out of the
                        conception of the ‘human force,’ impersonated in the ‘sturdy ditcher,’ the
                        ‘farmer roused to anger,’ the ‘active peasant,’ contrasting with and
                        conflicting with that other conception of the life of Nature. And as in
                        Lucretius the speculative ideas, penetrating through every region of the
                        wide domain traversed by him, elicit some poetic life out of its barrenest
                        places, so the two speculative ideas, of Nature as a living force, and of
                        man’s labour, vigilance, forethought in their relation to that force, impart
                        a feeling of imaginative delight to Virgil’s account of the most common
                        details of the husbandman’s toil. The strength and vivacity thus imparted to
                        the style has been well illustrated by Professor Conington in his
                        Introduction to the Georgics. It may be noted however that, even in this
                        imaginative recognition of the strength and force of man in conflict with
                        the force of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Nature, Virgil is still
                        following in the tracks of Lucretius. Such expressions as </p>

                        effectual results by his successor. But Conington has, in his notes, drawn
                        attention to another vein of feeling, which is all Virgil’s own, and which
                        enables him to give further variety and charm to these homely details. The
                        husbandman has not only his hard and incessant struggle—‘labor
                        improbus’—but he has the delight of success, the joy of contemplating the
                        new beauty and richness, created by the strength of his arm. This feeling

                        the poem, are those derived from earlier science and poetry. Of the
                        resources of learned allusion Lucretius makes a singularly sparing use. The
                        localising epithets and mythological names in which Virgil’s poem abounds
                        possessed no attraction for his austerer genius, nourished by the severe
                        models of an older time, and rejecting the ornaments and distractions from
                        the main interest familiar to Alexandrine literature. Virgil had already
                        shown in the Eclogues this tendency to overlay his native thought with the
                        spoils of Greek learning. Such phrases as ‘Strymoniae grues,’ ‘Pelusiacae
                        lentis,’ ‘Amyclaeum canem,’ ‘Idumaeas palmas,’—the refe<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rences to the ‘harvests of Mysia and Gargarus,’ to the
                        ‘vines of Ismarus,’ ‘Cytorus, waving with boxwood,’ etc. etc., must have
                        been charged, for Virgil’s contemporaries, in a way which they cannot be for
                        a modern reader, with the memories of foreign travel or of residence in
                        remote provinces, or with the interest attaching to lands recently made
                        known. To us their chief interest is that by their strangeness they enhance
                        the effect with which the more familiar names of Italian places are used.
                        Thus the contrasted pictures of the illimitable pastures of Libya and of the
                        wintry wastes of Scythia enable us to realise more exquisitely the charm of
                        that fresh<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> Italian pastoral scene

                        of the Eclogues with the deeper realism of the Georgics. Thus too the great
                        episode on the beauty and riches of Italy (ii. 136–176) is introduced in
                        immediate contrast to the account of the prodigal luxuriance of Nature in
                        the forests and jungles of the East. But even to a modern reader such

                        of poetry and adventure in the free range and ‘otia dia’ of pastoral
                        scenes,—of some more intimate union of the human soul with the soul of
                        mountains and woodland than is granted to the common generations of men. On
                        Virgil himself, to whom the whole of Greek poetry and legend was an open
                        page, the spell which they exercised was of the same kind as that exercised
                        by the magic of classical allusion on the poets and painters of the
                        Renaissance. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The contrast between Lucretius and Virgil, as regards their relation to the
                        ancient mythology, has already appeared in the examination of the
                        Invocations to their respective poems. This <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>contrast is still more brought out by the large use which Virgil makes of
                        mythological allusions in the body of his poem, as compared with the rare,
                        and generally polemical, references to the subject in Lucretius. Virgil
                        recalls the tales and poetical representations of mythology sometimes by
                        some suggestive epithet, or other qualifying expression, as in speaking of
                        ‘poppies steeped in the sleep of Lethe,’ ‘Halcyons dear to Thetis,’ ‘the
                        Cyllenian star,’ ‘the slow-rolling wains of the Eleusinian mother,’ and the
                        like. More frequently however he does this by direct mention of some of the
                        more familiar, and occasionally of some of the more recondite, tales which
                        had supplied materials to earlier poets and painters. Thus, in connexion
                        with the topic of lucky and unlucky days, he hints at the tale of the war of
                        the Giants with the Olympian gods, at that of Scylla and Nisus in connexion
                        with the signs of the weather, at that of the Centaurs and Lapithae—the
                        ‘brawl fought to the death over the wine cup’—in the account of the vine,
                        at that of the daughter of Inachus tormented in her wanderings by the
                        vengeance of Juno in connexion with the plague of flies with which cattle
                        were afflicted, etc. etc. Less familiar stories, of picturesque adventure or
                        of a kind of weird mystery, are revived in the passages— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such allusions came much more home to an ancient than to a modern reader.
                        They were familiar to him from the pages of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>poets, or from pictures adorning the walls of his own town and
                        country-houses, or seen in the temples and other sacred places of famous
                        Greek and Asiatic cities, and forming great part of the attraction of those
                        cities to travellers then, as the pictures seen in the galleries, palaces,
                        and churches of Rome, Florence, and Venice do to travellers now. But though
                        the colours of these poetic fancies have faded for us, they are felt to be a
                        legitimate source of variety in the poem, and to be an element of interest
                        connecting the humbler cares of the country-people with the refined tastes
                        of the educated class. They are not introduced as a substitute for truthful
                        representation of fact, but rather as adding a new grace to this
                        representation. Neither do they, as in Propertius, overlay the main subject
                        of the poem by their redundant use. They probably produced the same kind of
                        impression on an ancient reader, as allusions from the works of Latin or
                        Italian poets in Spenser or Milton produce on a modern reader. Occasionally
                        they may seem weak and faulty from their incongruity with the thought with
                        which they are associated. Thus in the passage at i. 60, etc.,— </p>

                        Lucretius was endowed above nearly every poet, ancient or modern. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Equally remote from the practice of Lucretius is the use made by Virgil of
                        that amalgamation of mythological fancy with the rudiments of science which
                        assigned names, personality, and a poetical history to the various
                        constellations:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Virgil’s practice is in accordance with that of all the Greek poets from
                        Homer and Hesiod down to the latest Alexandrine writers. He thus enriches
                        the treatment of his subject with the interest of early science, and with
                        the associations of the open-air life of hunters, herdsmen, and mariners in
                        primitive times. Lucretius is impressed by the splendour, wonder, and severe
                        majesty of the stars as they actually appear to us,—‘aeterni sidera mundi,’
                        ‘caeli labentia signa,’ ‘noctis signa severa,’—without any superadded
                        association of mythology or antiquity. Neither does he use that other
                        resource, by which Virgil adds an antique lustre to his subject—the
                        introduction of quaint phrases and turns of speech, derived from Hesiod,
                        such as ‘nudus ara, sere nudus,’ ‘laudato ingentia rura, Exiguum colito,’ or
                        those derived from the traditional peasant-lore of Italy,—‘hiberno
                        laetissima pulvere farra,’—which Virgil intermingles with the classic
                        elegance of his style. Still less could Lucretius appeal to the associations
                        of the popular religion. Such expressions as ‘fas et iura sinunt,’ ‘hiemes
                        orate serenas,’ ‘nulla religio vetuit,’ and the mention of old religious
                        ceremonies and practices prevalent in the country districts, such as that at

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the other hand, it is to be noticed how sparingly Virgil uses one of the
                        grandest resources in the repertory of Lucretius,—that of imaginative
                        analogies, through which familiar or unseen phenomena are made great or
                        palpable by association with other phenomena which immediately affect the
                        imagination with a sense of wonder and sublimity. The apprehension of these
                        analogies between great things in different spheres proceeds from the
                        inventive and intellectual faculty in the imagination,—that by which
                        intuitions of vast discoveries are obtained before observation and reason
                        can verify them; and in this faculty of imaginative reason Lucretius is as
                        superior to Virgil, as Virgil is to him in artistic accomplishment. One of
                        the few ‘similes’ in the Georgics is that often-quoted one, in which the
                        difficulty which man has in holding his own against the natural
                        deterioration of things is compared to the difficulty which a rower has in
                        holding his own against a strong adverse current (i. 201–203):— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The inferiority of Virgil to Lucretius, in that faculty of imagination,
                        which perceives an inner identity between great forces in the material and
                        in the spiritual world, is apparent also from a comparison of their
                        respective diction. There is often a creativeness, a boldness of invention
                        and insight into the deepest nature of things, in the language of Lucretius,
                        such as did not reappear again in Italian poetry till more than thirteen
                        centuries had passed, and which makes us feel how much nearer he was in many
                        ways than any other Latin poet to our modern modes of thought and feeling.
                        There is, on the other hand, scarcely any great poem from which so few
                        striking and original images can be quoted as from the Georgics. The
                        figurative language arising out of the perception of the analogy between the
                        vital processes of Nature and various modes of human sensibility is rather
                        like that unconscious identification of Nature with humanity out of which
                        mythology arose, than the conscious recognition of some common force or law
                        operating in totally distinct spheres. And even this identity or analogy
                        between the life of Nature and of man is not conceived with such power and
                        passion in Virgil as in Lucretius. But if Virgil’s language is inferior to
                        that of his predecessor not only in vivid creative power, but in clearness
                        and idiomatic purity, it is much superior in the uniform level of poetical
                        excellence which it maintains. In this respect Virgil compares favourably
                        with some of the greatest masters of style among English poets, for example
                        with Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron. There is nothing redundant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or monotonous in the style of the Georgics,
                        nothing trivial or mean; while always rich and pregnant with suggestion, it
                        is never overstrained or overloaded; while always elevated to the pitch of
                        poetry, it never seems to soar too far above the familiar aspects of the
                        world. Nothing shows the perfect sanity of Virgil’s genius more clearly than
                        his entire exemption from the besetting sin of our own didactic poetasters
                        of last century—a sin from which even Wordsworth himself is not altogether
                        free—that of calling common things by pompous names, and of dignifying
                        trifles by applying heroic phrases to them. If he seems sometimes to deviate
                        from this habitual temperance of manner in the account of his bee
                        communities, he does so purposely, to convey through this gentle vein of
                        irony something of that pensive meditativeness of spirit which is produced
                        in him by reflection on the transitory passions, joys, and vicissitudes of
                        our mortal life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The general superiority of Virgil’s art to that of Lucretius is equally
                        apparent in his rhythm. The powerful movement of spirit which Lucretius
                        feels in the presence of the sublimer spectacle of Nature and of the more
                        solemn things of human life does indeed produce isolated effects of majestic
                        speech and sonorously rhythmical cadence, swelling above the deep, strong,
                        monotonous flow of his ordinary verse, which neither Virgil nor any other
                        poet has surpassed. But in variety, equable smoothness and grandeur, in that
                        tempered harmony of sound which never disappoints and never burdens the ear,
                        it may be doubted whether the musical art of any poet has maintained such a
                        uniform level of excellence as that maintained in the Georgics. Virgil
                        produces more varied effects than Lucretius can do even in his more finished
                        passages, while at the same time binding himself by stricter laws in the
                        composition of his verse. This he does by the greater variety and greater
                        frequency of his pauses, by uniformly placing the words of strength and
                        emphasis in the strong positions of the line, and by a skilful regulation of
                        the succession of long and short, of accentuated and unaccentuated
                        syllables, and of lines of a more rapid or slower move<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ment. The result is that the feeling of his rhythm becomes a
                        main element in the realisation of his meaning. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The principal resources by which Virgil, in the didactic exposition of his
                        subject, avoids that monotony of effect which was likely to arise from the
                        strong Roman concentration of purpose with which his work was executed, and,
                        without deviating from the true perception of facts, is able to invest a
                        somewhat narrow range of interests with charm and dignity,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> are thus seen to be, first his feeling of Nature, of man’s relation to it,
                        of his joy in the results of his toil, and, secondly, the associations of
                        strange lands, of mythology, of antiquity, and of religious custom. The
                        instruments by which these resources are made available are the careful
                        choice and combinations of words and the well-practised melody of his verse.
                        These resources and instruments have been considered in relation to and
                        contrast with those employed by Lucretius. There is, moreover, this
                        difference between the method of the two poets, that Virgil is much more of
                        a conscious artist, that he seems to go more in search of illustrations and
                        the means of artistic embellishment, that he endeavours to make for himself
                        a wreath, ‘undique decerptam;’ while the occasional accessions of a more
                        powerful poetic interest to the ordinary exposition of Lucretius arise
                        naturally in the process of his argument, from the habit of his mind to
                        observe the outward world, the ways of all living things, and the condition
                        of man in their intimate connexion with the great speculative ideas of his
                        philosophy. His modes of varying the interest of his subject and adorning it
                        are thus more simple and homogeneous; they work more in harmony with the
                        purpose of his poem, so as to produce a pervading unity of sentiment and
                        impression. The variety of resources used by Virgil gives, at first sight, a
                        composite character to his art. But there is, deeper than this apparent
                        composite character, an inner unity of tone and sentiment pervading the
                        whole work. The source of this unity is the deep love and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pride which he feels in every detail of his
                        subject, from the great human interests with which these details are
                        associated in his mind. What these human interests are is brought out
                        prominently in the episodes of the poem, which still remain to be
                        considered. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The finest poetry in the didactic poems of Lucretius and of Virgil and the
                        thoughts which give the highest interest to their respective poems are
                        contained in passages of considerable length, rising out of the general
                        level or undulations of the poem into elevations which at first sight seem
                        isolated and unconnected with one another. It may be doubted whether even
                        the power of thought and style in Lucretius could have secured immortality
                        to a mere systematic exposition of the Atomic philosophy; nor could the mere
                        didactic exposition of the precepts of agriculture, though varied by all the
                        art and resources of Virgil, have gained for the Georgics the unique place
                        that poem holds in literature. It is in their episodes that each poet brings
                        out the moral grandeur, and thereby justifies the choice of his subject. In
                        Lucretius, these passages are introduced sometimes in the ordinary march of
                        his argument, more often at the beginning or completion of some important
                        division of it, and are intended both to add poetical charm to the subject
                        and to show man’s true relation to the Universe, and the attitude of mind
                        which that relation demands of him. The object of Virgil in some of his
                        minor and in one or two of his larger episodes may be merely to relieve the
                        dryness of exposition by some descriptive or reflective charm. But even
                        these passages will in general be found to draw attention to the religious,
                        ethical, or national bearing of his subject. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Some of these passages have been suggested by parallel passages either in
                        Hesiod or Lucretius. The largest of all the episodes, that with which the
                        poem concludes, has, for reasons already considered, only a slight and
                        external relation to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>great ideas and
                        interests with which the poem deals. But the three most important passages,
                        those of most original invention and profound feeling, viz. those at Book I.
                        466 to the end of the Book, Book II. 136 to 177, and also from line 458 to
                        the end, serve like those great cardinal passages in the Aeneid, in which
                        the action is projected from a remote legendary past into the actual
                        present, to bring into light the true central interest of the poem,—the
                        bearing of the whole subject on the greatness and well-being of the Italian
                        race. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Any of the passages which are not needed for the special practical purpose
                        of the poem may be regarded as episodical, such, for instance, as that
                        thoroughly Lucretian passage in Book I. in which the feelings of rooks are
                        explained on purely physical principles, or that passage of Book IV.
                        inspired by the teaching of an opposite school, in which the theory of a
                        divine principle pervading the world—the same theory as that accepted as
                        his own by Virgil in Aeneid VI.—is enunciated as a probable explanation of
                        the higher instinct of the bees. And it is characteristic of the eclecticism
                        of Virgil’s mode of thought, and also of the lingering regret with which he
                        regards the evanescent fancies of the old mythology, that he not only
                        combines these tenets of the most materialistic and most spiritualistic
                        philosophies in the same poem, but that the philosophic or theosophic
                        solution of Book IV. 219, etc. comes shortly after a passage in which the
                        same phenomenon is accounted for on the ground of the service rendered by
                        bees in feeding the infant Jove in the cavern of Mount Dicte. Another
                        passage of a scientific rather than a philosophic character is that at Book
                        I. 233, etc., in which the five zones girding the heaven and the earth are
                        described in language closely translated from Eratosthenes. Besides the
                        scientific interest which this passage must have had to the poet’s
                        contemporaries, it serves to draw forth Virgil’s antagonism to the religious
                        unbelief of Lucretius, in the expression </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another passage of a semi-philosophical character is that at Book III.
                        242–283, in which the Lucretian idea of the all-pervading influence of the
                        physical emotion of love over all living things in sea, earth, and air,—an
                        idea in which Lucretius was anticipated by Euripides<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a> and by other earlier
                        Greek poets,—appears in combination with the purely mythological conception
                        of the direct personal agency of Venus, and with the legend of ‘the mares of
                        Glaucus of Potniae.’ </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More important than these, as illustrative of the main ideas and feelings of
                        the poem, but still subsidiary to the greater episodes, are the following:
                        Book I. 121–159, Book II. 323–345; and in the same class may be included
                        III. 339–383, and IV. 125–148. The first of these, ‘Pater ipse colendi,’
                        etc., is immediately suggested by Hesiod’s account of the Golden Age; but
                        the greater part of it, the account of the progress of the various arts of
                        life, is simply a summary of the long account of human progress at the end
                        of the fifth Book of Lucretius. The idea of the purpose with which
                        Providence has imposed labour on man is Virgil’s own; and this thought
                        contributes much of its ethical meaning to the poem. The passage ‘Ver adeo
                        frondi nemorum,’ etc., in which all the glory of Nature as she unfolds
                        herself in the exuberant life of an Italian spring is described in lines of
                        surpassing beauty and tenderness, is thoroughly Lucretian in feeling, idea,
                        and expression. The charm of climate, of vegetation, and of life is in
                        complete harmony with the specially Italian character of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the second Book. The digression at Book III. 339,
                        ‘Quid tibi pastores Libyae,’ containing the elaborate picture of a Scythian
                        winter, suggested by the winter scene in Hesiod, also serves through the
                        effect of contrast to heighten the charm of the fresh pastoral life of Italy
                        described in the lines immediately preceding. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The actual description of winter has been criticised unfavourably, and not
                        altogether without justice, by one of the most independent and at the same
                        time most scholarly of English critics<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>, who compares it with a corresponding passage in Thomson. It
                        is inferior in simplicity and direct force of representation to the
                        corresponding picture in Hesiod. Virgil’s imagination seems to require that
                        even where the objects or scenes he describes are taken from books, they
                        should be such that he could verify them in his own experience. It is this
                        apparent verification, where the subject is not originally suggested by his
                        own observation, that imparts the marvellous truthfulness to his art. Such

                        Oebaliae,’ etc. Virgil here introduces himself in his own person, and draws
                        a picture <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of one whom he had known, and who
                        had interested him as actually realising that life of labour and of
                        happiness in the results of his labour, which in the body of the poem is
                        held up as an abstract ideal. The scene of this vivid reminiscence,—the

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is to ‘that nook of earth’ that Horace looks, if the unkind Fates forbid
                        his residence at his favourite Tibur, for a resting-place for his ‘age to
                        wear away in.’ But it is not only to the local charm that attention is
                        drawn, and to the beauty of plant, flower, and fruit, created by the labour
                        of love which the old Cilician gardener—some survivor probably from the
                        Eastern wars of Pompey—bestowed on his neglected spot of ground. Here also
                        the true moral of the poem is pointed, that in the life of rural industry
                        there is a deep source of happiness altogether independent of wealth, and
                        which wealth cannot buy:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A more prominent place is assumed by the two episodes with which the third
                        and fourth Books close. In the first of these, which extends from line 478
                        to 566, and which describes a great outbreak of cattle-plague among the
                        Noric Alps and the district round the Timavus,—a locality which seems to
                        have had a special attraction to Virgil’s imagination<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a>,—he aims at painting a rival picture
                        to that of the plague at Athens <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with which
                        the poem of Lucretius ends. It would be unfair to compare the unfinished
                        piece of the older poet, overcrowded as it is with detail and technical
                        phraseology, with an elaborate specimen of Virgil’s descriptive power,
                        exercised on a kind of subject in which the speculative genius of the one
                        poet gave him no advantage over the careful and truthful art of the other.
                        Yet, as has been already pointed out<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a>, there are here and there strokes of imaginative power in the
                        larger sketch, and marks of insight into human nobleness, roughly indeed
                        expressed, as at 1243–6— </p>

                        great beauty however of pastoral scene, of pathos and human sympathy, of
                        ethical contrast between the simple wants of the lower animals and the
                        artificial luxury of human life, in Virgil’s description. In the lines

                        measure of their importance, the long episode at the end of the fourth Book,
                        from line 315 to 558, would have to be regarded as of nearly equal value to
                        all the others put together. And yet, notwithstanding the metrical beauty of
                        the passage, it must be difficult for any one who is penetrated by the
                        pervading sentiment of the Georgics to reach this point in the poem without
                        a strong feeling of regret that the jealousy of Augustus had interfered with
                        its original conclusion. As a Greek fable, composed after some Alexandrine
                        model, mainly concerned with the fortunes of Orpheus and Eurydice,—for the
                        shepherd Aristaeus, the </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> really plays altogether a secondary part in the episode,—it has little to
                        do with rural life, and nothing at all to do with Italy. Its professed
                        object is to give a fabulous explanation of an impossible phenomenon, though
                        one apparently accepted both by Mago and Democritus. To enrich this episode
                        with a beauty not its own, Virgil has robbed his Aeneid—on the composition
                        of which he must have been well advanced when he was called on, after the
                        death of Gallus in 26 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, to provide a
                        substitute for the passage written in his honour—of some beautiful lines
                        which are more in keeping with the larger representation and profounder
                        feeling of the epic poem, than with the transient interest attaching to this
                        recast of a well-known story. Even regarded simply as an epyllion or epic
                        idyl, it may be questioned whether the Pastor Aristaeus is of an interest
                        equal to that of the epic idyl of Catullus, ‘Peliaco quondam prognatae
                        vertice pinus,’ etc. There is this coincidence between the poems, that they
                        each contain one story or idyllic representation within another, and in each
                        case it is to the secondary representation that the most pathetic and
                        passionate interest belongs. </p>
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Opinions may differ as to whether the passion of Ariadne or the sorrow of
                        Orpheus is represented with most skill. There seems this difference between
                        the two, that in the one we feel we are reading a fable, that the situation
                        is altogether remote from experience, that it is one suited for a picture or
                        a poem of fancy. The beautiful picture of Ariadne, on the other hand,
                        appears like one drawn from the life, and her passionate complaint is like
                        that of a living woman. But still more undoubted is the superiority of
                        Catullus in pictorial or statuesque reproduction seen in that part of his
                        poem in which the original subject, the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, is
                        described. Catullus, above all other Latin poets, except perhaps Ovid, can
                        bring a picture from human life or from outward nature before the inward
                        eye; and this power is, much more than Virgil’s power of suggesting deep and
                        delicate shades of feeling, appropriate to the more limited compass of the
                        idyl. It is no disparagement to Virgil to say that in this kind of art he is
                        inferior to Catullus. Catullus, though a true Italian in temperament,
                        largely endowed with and freely using the biting raillery—‘Italum
                        acetum’—which ancient writers ascribe to the race, had in his genius, more
                        than any Roman writer, the disinterested delight in art, irrespective of any
                        personal associations, characteristic of the Greek imagination. Virgil’s
                        art, on the other hand, produces its deepest impressions only when his heart
                        is moved. Even in the Eclogues this is for the most part true. Something
                        must touch his personal sympathies, his moral or religious nature, or his
                        national feeling, before he is roused to his highest creative effort. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the three cardinal passages which remain to be considered, in the
                        composition of which the deeper elements of Virgil’s nature were powerfully
                        moved, the impression which the changing state of the national fortunes
                        produced upon him is vividly stamped. The first of these (i. 464 to the end)
                        was written in the years of uncertainty and alarm preceding the outbreak of
                        the last of the great Civil Wars. The unsettlement all over the Empire, from
                        its eastern boundary to its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>furthest limits
                        in Europe,—the agitation and impetuous sweep of the river before plunging
                        into the abyss,—is described and symbolised in the concluding lines of the

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This state of alarm is shown to be connected with the great national crime
                        which Rome was still atoning,—the murder of Julius Caesar. The episode
                        arises immediately out of the enumeration of the signs of the weather,
                        which, from their importance to the husbandman, are treated of at
                        considerable length in the body of the poem. As the sun is the surest index
                        of change in the physical, so is he said to be in the political atmosphere.
                        The eclipse which occurred soon after the murder of Caesar is regarded as a
                        sign of compassion for his fate and of abhorrence of the crime. Then follows
                        an enumeration of other omens which accompanied or preceded that
                        event,—some of them violations of natural law, such as those which occur in
                        the narrative of Livy, when any great disaster was impending over the Roman

                        awe-struck citizens of Rome. The whole passage is pervaded by that strong
                        sense of awe before an invisible Power—the ‘religio dira’—by which the

                        imagination, and looking far forward into the future, the poet reminds us of

                        idea based on religious belief and national traditions, of a life of pure

                        himself nor any other poet has surpassed. Virgil creates a new ideal of
                        happiness for the contemplation of his countrymen by combining the old
                        realistic delight in the husbandman’s life with the imaginative longing for
                        the peace and innocence of a Saturnian Age, and with that new delight in the
                        living beauty of the world and in the charm of ancient memories which it was
                        his especial office to communicate. This ideal is contrasted, as is the
                        older poet’s ideal of ‘plain living and high thinking,’ with the pomp and
                        magnificence of city life,— </p>

                        contemplation in accordance with which Lucretius lived and wrote. The
                        Virgilian ideal, like that of Lucretius, recognised a heart at peace and
                        independent of Fortune as a greater source of happiness than any external
                        good. But this peace the one poet sought for in a superiority to the common

                        the two men is that Virgil’s ordinary feelings and beliefs are in unison
                        with the common ways of life; he has a more active sympathy with the toils
                        and pleasures of simple men; and, above all, he regards it as the highest
                        good for man, not to secure peace of mind for himself, but to be useful in
                        supporting others, in contributing to the well-being of his country, of his
                        family, even of the animals associated with his toil:— </p>

                </h2>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The consideration of the motives which influenced Virgil to undertake the
                    composition of the Georgics, of the form of art adopted by him, of the national
                    interest attaching to his subject, of the materials used by him and the sources
                    from which he derived them, of the author who most influenced him in speculative
                    idea and in the general manner of treating his subject, leads to the conclusion
                    that, in its essential characteristics, the poem is a genuine work of Italian
                    art and inspiration. If the original motive influencing him was the ambition to
                    treat of rural life in the serious spirit of Hesiod, as he had done in the
                    lighter vein of Theocritus, that motive was soon lost in the strong impulse to
                    invest with charm and dignity the kind of life in which the Italian mind placed
                    its ideal of worth and happiness. By thus identifying himself with a great
                    national object Virgil raised himself to a higher level of art than that
                    attained by poets whose interests are purely personal and literary. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Next to satire, there was no form of poetry which had more of a Roman character
                    than didactic poetry. By becoming a province of Roman art, this form acquired
                    all its dignity and capacity of greatness. And though the Georgics, being a work
                    of Italian culture as well as of Italian inspiration, could not escape some
                    relation, not in form only but in materials and mode of expression, to Greek
                    originals, there is no great work of Latin genius, except the Satires and
                    Epistles of Horace, in which the debt thus incurred is so small. And not only is
                    the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>debt small in quantity, but it is incurred
                    to authors much inferior to Virgil in creative power and poetical feeling. In
                    using borrowed materials he makes the mind of Greece tributary to his own
                    national design. But his most valuable materials are derived either from
                    personal observation, or from Latin authors who had put on record the results of
                    their observation: and his largest debt, in imaginative feeling and conception,
                    is incurred not to any Greek author, but to the most powerful and original of
                    Roman poets and thinkers. The speculative idea, which gives something of
                    philosophical consistency to the poem, was, if not one of pure Italian
                    conception, yet made more truly real and vital through the experience of the
                    force and endurance exercised by the strong men of Italy in subduing the earth
                    to their will, and in constructing their great material works (‘operum
                    laborem’), such as their roads, baths, aqueducts, harbours, encampments, and
                    great draining works, by which they provided the comforts of life (‘commoda
                    vitae’) and defended themselves against their enemies or the maligner influence
                    of the elements. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The language of Virgil himself and the testimony of ancient commentators confirm
                    the impression, that the object of which he was most distinctly conscious in the
                    composition of the poem was the ‘glorification of Italy,’—of the land itself in
                    its fertility and beauty, and of the life most congenial to Italian sentiment.
                    Even to a greater extent than he may have intended, Virgil, through the national
                    mould in which his thought was cast and the national colour of his sympathies,
                    fulfils this representative office. Where the poem seems to a modern reader to
                    fail in human interest, the interest which it had for the poet’s countrymen is
                    revived by dwelling in thought on this representative character. When the
                    associations appealed to are of Greek rather than of Italian origin, we have to
                    remember that the poem was addressed to a highly educated class of readers, at
                    the time when the Roman mind had been most enlarged and enriched, but had not
                    yet been satiated by Greek studies. Yet this kind of appeal is quite subsidiary
                    to that made to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>native sensibilities of the
                    Romans. It is to commend to their love and admiration a purely Italian ideal
                    that Virgil employs the resources of Greek learning, as well as all the strength
                    and delicacy of his own genius. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A rapid review of the tastes, sympathies, and affections on the part of his
                    readers to which Virgil appeals, both in the body of his poem and in its finer
                    episodes, will show that they all contribute to produce this representative
                    character. Where some of the details of the poem seem to fail in poetic
                    interest, they still have the interest of being characteristic of the Italian
                    mind. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> 1. The poem professes to impart practical instruction on the best method of
                    cultivating the land, of propagating trees, of breeding cattle, horses, etc., of
                    profiting by the industry of bees:— </p>

                </div>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This is the obvious and ostensible purpose of the poem; and the truth and
                    accuracy of the instruction were important elements in the estimate which the
                    countrymen of the poet formed of its value. Columella and Pliny, while
                    controverting him on a few minor points<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a>, attest his practical knowledge as an
                    agriculturist and a naturalist. Similar testimony is given by some modern
                    writers competent to speak with authority on these subjects<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a>. Neither ancient nor modern critics regard him as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>free from liability to mistake, and the tendency of
                    his mind to believe in marvellous deviations from natural law exposed him to
                    errors into which less imaginative writers were not likely to fall; but the
                    substantial accuracy of his observations and acquired knowledge seems to be
                    attested both by positive and negative evidence. It is not a question as to
                    whether the operations described in Virgil satisfy the requirements of skilled
                    or even of unskilled farming in the present day, or whether he does not fall
                    into mistakes in natural history which a modern reader, with no scientific
                    knowledge of the subject, may easily detect; but whether he has adequately
                    represented the methods of ancient Italian agriculture, and whether he is a
                    trustworthy exponent of the scientific beliefs of his age, and an accurate
                    observer of those phenomena which were as accessible to an ancient as to a
                    modern enquirer. On these points he satisfied the best critics among his
                    countrymen. The general truth of his observation is further attested by the
                    survival in Southern Europe, into comparatively recent times, of some of the
                    processes described by him, which seem most remote from our ordinary
                        experience<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>. It is attested also by the accuracy of his description
                    of the unchanging phenomena of Nature, and of the habits of animals. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A modern reader may think the value of his poetry little, if at all enhanced, by
                    the rank which he may claim among the ‘scriptores rei rusticae.’ It may seem
                    matter for regret that so much of the faculty, which should have given permanent
                    delight <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the world, should have been employed
                    in conveying temporary instruction. His very fidelity to the office of a teacher
                    detracts somewhat from his poetic office. Though it satisfies our curiosity to
                    know how the ancient Italians tilled their lands and cultivated the vine, yet
                    this satisfaction is quite distinct from the joy which the poetical treatment of
                    a poetical subject gives to the imagination. It is not as repertories of useful
                    information that the great writers of Greece and Rome are to be studied. Their
                    importance in this way has long since been superseded. Each generation adds to
                    the stock of knowledge in the world, modifies the results arrived at by the
                    preceding generation, and dispenses with the works in which these results have
                    been embodied. But a work of power, stimulating moral and intellectual
                    feeling,—whether in the form of poem, history, speech, or philosophic
                    dialogue,—may acquire from long antiquity even a stronger hold over the
                    imagination than it originally possessed<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a>. In
                    the didactic poems of Lucretius and Virgil the information conveyed by them
                    possesses permanent value, in so far as it is coloured by human feeling,—in so
                    far as we recognise the passion or affection by which the poet was stirred in
                    acquiring his knowledge and in conveying it to sympathetic readers. And as the
                    scientific enthusiasm of Lucretius animates the driest details of his argument,
                    so the love entertained for his subject by Virgil,—as an Italian, the son of a
                    small Italian land-holder,— </p>

                    unintelligible to us,—brightens with the gleam of human and poetical feeling
                    the technical teaching of the traditional precepts of Italian husbandry. The
                    position of a teacher assumed by him,—a position which no great Greek or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>English poet could gracefully
                    maintain,—impresses us with the thorough adaptation of the form of the poem to
                    the sober practical understanding of the Italian race. Horace mentions this love
                    of teaching and learning as one of the notes distinguishing the Roman from the
                    Greek genius:— </p>

                    faithfully performed the office which he undertook; and the fact of his
                    undertaking this office helps to bring home to us the practical, unspeculative
                    genius of those to whom his poem was in the first place addressed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> 2. Not only the instruction directly conveyed in the poem, but the frequent
                    illustrations from geography, mythology, and astronomy, have much less meaning
                    to us than they had to the contemporaries of the poet. Yet they help to make us
                    realise the relation in which the Rome and Italy of the Augustan Age stood to
                    the rest of the world and to the culture of the past. By the references to the
                    varied products of other lands we are reminded of the active commercial
                    intercourse between Rome and the East,—a feature of the age of which we are
                    also often reminded in the Odes, Satires, and Epistles of Horace. We see how the
                    success of the Roman arms had made the products of the whole world—the ‘saffron
                    dye of Tmolus,’ the ‘ivory of India,’ the ‘spices of Arabia,’ the ‘iron of the
                    Chalybians,’ the ‘medicinal drugs of Pontus,’ the ‘brood-mares of Epirus<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a>’—part of the possessions of Rome. We
                    are reminded too of the fact that many Romans and Italians were settled as
                    colonists in the provinces of the Empire, and that Virgil had them also in view
                    in the instruction which he imparts<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a>. The frequent allusions to Greek mythology and to the
                    constellations, on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>other hand, help to
                    remind us that the art and science of the past, as well as the material products
                    of the world, had now been diverted to the enjoyment and use of the new
                    inheritors of intellectual culture. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> 3. It was seen how assiduously Virgil, in the body of his poem, inculcates the
                    necessity and duty of labour. And though the ‘glorification of labour’ was found
                    to be rather a derivative and tributary stream than the main current of interest
                    in the poem, yet it is impossible to doubt that to the mind of Virgil this
                    assiduous toil of the husbandman, on a work so congenial and surrounded with
                    such accessories of peaceful happiness, had a special attraction, even
                    independent of its results. This recognition of the dignity of labour owes
                    nothing to a Greek original. A life of intellectual leisure was the ideal of the
                    Greeks. Hesiod indeed does dwell on the necessity of labour, as the ground both
                    of worldly well-being and divine approval,—and this is another point of
                    affinity between him and Virgil,—but the line in which he claims consideration
                    for work, </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> is apologetic in tone; and, moreover, Hesiod can hardly be regarded as a typical
                    Greek. There seems to be no word in the Greek language equivalent to the grave
                    Roman word ‘industria.’ Perhaps it is owing to the disesteem in which labour was
                    held by Greek writers that industry is scarcely ranked among virtues, nor
                    idleness among vices, even by modern moralists. When long after the time of
                    Homer a new poet arose in Greece, appealing to a great popular sentiment, it was
                    in their passion for the great public games that he found the point of contact
                    with the hearts of his countrymen. The Romans, on the other hand, show a great
                    capacity for labour in every field of exertion,—in war and the government of
                    men, in law and literature, in business transactions, in the construction of
                    vast works of utility, and in cultivating the land. And of these, next to war
                    and government, the last was most congenial <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
                    the national mind. The land was to the Romans the chief field of their industry
                    and the original source of their wealth, as the sea was the scene of occupation
                    and adventure to the Greeks, and, through the outlet which it gave to the
                    results of their artistic ingenuity, the great source of their prosperity. The
                    Odyssey is a poem inspired, in a great degree, by the impulse which first sent
                    the Greek nation forth on its career of maritime and colonising enterprise. The
                    Georgics are inspired by that impulse which first started the Latin race on its
                    career of conquest, and which continued to animate the struggle with the
                    reluctant forces of Nature, as it had animated the struggle with the other races
                    of Italy for the possession of the soil. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> 4. Again, we find that the poem is pervaded by the poetical feeling of Nature.
                    And Virgil, more than any other poet, presents that aspect of Nature in which
                    the outward world appeared to the educated Italian mind. The personality and
                    individual life attributed to natural objects, such as trees, rivers, winds,
                    etc., belongs to a stage of conception between the Greek anthropomorphism and
                    the recognition by the imagination of universal law and interdependence of
                    phenomena. Modern poets consciously personify natural objects with more boldness
                    and varied sympathy than Virgil. His conception of the life and personal
                    attributes of natural objects appears to be less a conscious creative effort of
                    the imagination, than an unconscious impression from outward things; an
                    impression produced in a state of passive contemplation, rather than of active
                    adventure; and an impression produced by qualities of a serene and tender
                    beauty, rather than by those of a bolder or sublimer aspect. In all these
                    respects Virgil represents a stage in the culture of the imagination between
                    that of the early Greek poets and artists, and that of the most imaginative
                    poets and painters of modern times. The familiar beauty of the outward world, as
                    it was felt by a Roman or Italian, was expressed in the Latin word ‘amoenum.’
                    Thus Horace describes his retreat among the Sabine hills, as not only dear to
                    him personally, but as beautiful in itself:— </p>

                    of the long summer day described at Georg. iii. 323–338,—from the early dawn
                    when the fields are fresh beneath the morning-star; through the gathering warmth
                    of the later hours, when the groves are loud with the chirping of the
                    grasshoppers and the herds collect around the deep water-pools; through the
                    burning heat of midday, from which the shade of some huge oak or some grove of

                    the charm of freedom and solitude,—yet not too remote from human
                    neighbourhood,—of the changing aspects of the sky, and of the picturesque

                    with truthful effect. The love of Nature in Lucretius appears apart from local
                    associations. In Horace this feeling seems to link itself to places dear to him
                    from the memories of childhood, or from the personal experience of later years.
                    In Virgil the feeling is both general as in Lucretius, and combined with
                    attachment to or interest in particular places as in Horace. But Virgil is able
                    to feel enthusiasm not only for places dear to him through personal association,
                    but for all which appeal to his sentiment of national pride. As was seen in the
                    last chapter, the episode, which perhaps more than any other brings out the
                    inspiring thought of the poem, is devoted to a celebration of the varied
                    beauties of the land; and the names of Clitumnus, of Larius, and Benacus are
                    still dearer to the world because they are for ever intermingled with ‘the rich
                    Virgilian rustic measure<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a>.’ In the body of the poem also we find many
                    local references to the northern, central, and southern regions of Italy. The
                    light bark, hollowed out of the alder, is launched on the rapid flood of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Po; the starwort, out of which wreaths are made
                    to adorn the altars of the gods, is gathered by shepherds by the winding banks
                    of the Mella (a river in Northern Italy mentioned also by Catullus); the
                    meadow-land which unfortunate Mantua lost is adduced as a type of the best kind
                    of pasture, and the land in the neighbourhood of Capua and the region skirting
                    Mount Vesuvius as that most suitable for corn-crops. We read also of the
                    rose-beds of Paestum,—of the olives clothing the sides of the Samnian
                    Taburnus,—of the woodland pastures of Sila,—of those by the banks of the
                    Silarus, on Alburnus green with ilexes, and by the dry torrent-bed of the
                    Tanager,—and of the yellow cornfields through which the dark Galaesus flows.
                    The Aeneid affords further testimony of the interest which Virgil awakens in the
                    region which forms the distant environment of Rome. But the sentiment of the
                    Georgics is a sentiment of peace inspired by the land, quite different from that
                    inspired by the Imperial City, and from the memories of war and conquest with
                    which the neighbourhood of Rome is associated. And though the aspect which
                    Nature generally presents in the poem is that of her nobler mood, yet that air
                    of indolent repose which characterises her presence in the Eclogues is not
                    altogether absent from the severer poem. The sense of rest after toil—‘molles
                    sub arbore somni,’—the quiet contemplation of wide and peaceful
                    landscapes,—‘latis otia fundis,’—relieve the strain of strenuous labour which
                    is enforced as the indispensable condition of realising the glory of the land. </p>

                    was happiest and best in the old Italian faith and life. The poetical belief in

                    the great gods of the land, Faunus and Saturnus. Human life appeared to Hesiod
                    as well as to Virgil to be in immediate dependence on the gods. But the graver
                    aspect of Virgil’s faith is purer and happier than that of Hesiod; as the trust
                    in a just and beneficent father is purer and happier than the fear of a jealous
                    task-master. But on the other hand, the faith of Virgil is less noble than that
                    of Aeschylus and of Sophocles. It is more of a passive yielding to the longing
                    of the human heart and to the impulses of an aesthetic emotion, than that union
                    of natural piety with insight into the mystery of life which no great poets,
                    Pagan or Christian (unless it may be Dante), exhibit in equal measure with the
                    two great Athenian dramatists. In the religious spirit of Virgil, which accepts
                    and does not question, which finds its resource in prayer rather than in
                    reverent contemplation and searching out of the ways of God, we may recognise a
                    true note of his nationality,—a submissive attitude in presence of the
                    Invisible Power, derived from the race whose custom it was to veil the head in
                    sacrifice and in approaching the images of their gods<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>. </p>

                    Georgics. The negative elements in that ideal were seen to be exemption from the
                    violent passions and pleasures of the world. And in these negative elements the
                    ideal of the Georgics coincides with that of Lucretius. But, on the positive
                    side, Virgil’s ideal implies the active performance of duties to the family and
                    to the State. One has only to remember the low esteem in which women were held
                    and the indifference to family ties in the palmiest days of Athenian civili<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sation, or to recall the ideal State of Plato’s

                    pleasant and manners more humane, were ranked among the virtues by Greek
                    philosophy; and the first is treated by Aristotle, not only as a single virtue,
                    but as the condition under which all virtue can best be realised: but natural
                    affection is regarded as a mere instinct, and the duties of family life do not
                    fall under any of those conditions with which ethical philosophy concerns
                    itself. On the other hand, the legendary history of the early Republic, and many
                    great examples, in the midst of the corruption of the later Republic and of the
                    Empire, prove that the ideal of domestic virtue and affection among the Romans
                    was no mere passing fancy or dream of an age of primitive innocence, but was in
                    harmony with the national conscience throughout the whole course of their

                    Romans over the Athenians of the times of Cleisthenes, Themistocles, and
                    Pericles. And while each people, in its best days, was equally ready to serve
                    the Republic in war and by the performance of public duties, and while the Roman
                    perhaps more than the Athenian regarded the labour of his hands as a service due
                    from him<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a>, the Athenian freely gave the higher
                    energy of his genius to make the life of his fellow-citizens brighter and
                    nobler. And it is the peculiar glory of the Athenians of the fifth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>,—the glory claimed for them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in one of the speeches attributed to their great Statesman by
                    their great Historian,—that they combined this devotion to the common good with
                    a high development of all personal excellence. But in Athens this union of
                    national and individual energy and virtue was of very brief duration. On the
                    other hand, the lasting greatness of the Roman Commonwealth was purchased by the
                    sacrifice of the energies and accomplishments which add to the grace and
                    enjoyment of individual existence. The greatness and permanence of the race, not

                    artistic execution. It is the finest work of Italian art, made perfect by the
                    long education of Greek studies. More than any work in Latin literature the
                    Georgics approach to the symmetry of form, the harmony of proportion, the unity
                    of design and tone, characteristic of the purest art of Greece. But it is not in
                    any sense a copy formed after any Greek pattern. It was seen that out of the
                    more rudimentary attempts of Greek literature in this particular form of poetry
                    Virgil <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>created a new and nobler type, which
                    never has been, and probably never will be, improved on. The execution of the
                    poem is characterised by the genial susceptibility and enthusiasm of the Italian
                    temperament, by the firm structure of all Roman work and the practical
                    moderation and dignity of the Roman mind, and by a kind of meditative and
                    pensive grace peculiar to the poet himself. The thought of the poem is not
                    separable from the sentiment pervading it. And in this respect there is a marked
                    difference between the genius of Virgil and of Lucretius. However much the
                    speculative activity of Lucretius is charged with feeling, yet the thought
                    stands out, clearly defined, through the atmosphere surrounding it. The
                    melancholy of Lucretius, though it was the result partly of disposition,—the
                    reaction perhaps of a strongly passionate temperament,—and partly of his
                    relation to his age, was yet a state of mind for which he could assign definite
                    grounds. That of Virgil was probably also in a great measure the result of
                    temperament; but it seems to be a mood habitual to one who meditated much
                    inwardly on the misery of the world, who was moved by compassion for all sights
                    of sorrow or suffering<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a>, and was yet unable to shape this sense of ‘the burthen of the
                    mystery’ into articulate thought. The atmosphere of the poem has become one with
                    its substance. The fusion of meditation and feeling derived from the individual
                    genius of the poet imparts a distinctively original charm to the style of the
                    Georgics. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The style is thus, in a great degree, Virgil’s own, and owes little to the
                    borrowed beauties of Greek expression. Though the language of the Alexandrine
                    poets is sometimes reproduced, yet the beauty of those transferred passages
                    arises from the grace given to them, not from that borrowed from them. The same
                        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may be said of the use sometimes made of
                    the quaint diction of Hesiod. In one or two striking passages, such as that </p>

                </div>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil has adopted the language of the Iliad<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a>; and though it is impossible to improve on that, yet there is no
                    slavish imitation of it; only a new picture is painted, recalling, by some vivid
                    touches, a former piece by the great master. If detraction is to be made from
                    the originality of expression in the Georgics, the debt due by Virgil was
                    incurred to his own countryman. In adopting modes of expression from Lucretius,
                    Virgil brings down the bold creativeness of his original to a tone more suited
                    to the habitual sobriety of the Italian imagination. He often fixes into the
                    form of some general thought what appears in Lucretius as a living movement or
                    individualised action. And this tendency to abstract rather than concrete
                    representation is in accordance with the Roman mould of mind. We notice also how
                    much more sparingly he uses such compound words as ‘navigerum,’ ‘silvifragis,’
                    etc., by which the earlier poets endeavoured to force the harder metal of the
                    Latin language into the flexibility of Greek speech. Virgil felt that these
                    innovations were unsuited to the genius of the Latin tongue, and endeavoured to
                    enlarge its capacities by novel constructions and by using old words with a new
                    application rather than by novel formations of words. But this gain was perhaps
                    more than compensated by the loss which the language suffered in idiomatic
                    purity and clearness. </p>

                </h2>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The distinction between what is called the primitive and the literary epic has
                    become one of the commonplaces of criticism. The two kinds of narrative poem
                    belong to totally different epochs in civilisation; they are also the products
                    of very different national temperaments and faculties. It is somewhat remarkable
                    that those literatures which are richest in literary epics—the ancient Latin,
                    the modern Italian, and the English—are those which possess few or no native
                    poems either of the type realised in the Nibelungen-Lied, the Song of Roland,
                    and poems of that class, or of the type realised in the Iliad and Odyssey; nor
                    is there, in connexion with the earlier traditions of the Italian or the English
                    race, that cycle of heroic adventure and personages in which such poems have
                    their origin. The composition of the Aeneid and of the Paradise Lost implies
                    powers of combination, of arranging great masses of materials, of concentration
                    of the mind on a single object, more analogous to those which produced the vast
                    historical work of Livy and ‘The Decline and Fall’ of Gibbon, than to the
                    spontaneity, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">naïveté</span></span>, the rapidity of conception and
                    utterance, and that immediate sympathy between poet and people, to which we owe
                    the continuous poems developed out of some germ of popular ballad or national
                    legend. It was the peculiar glory of Greece, that in the earlier stage of her
                    literary development she manifested not only a perfection of expression and of
                    art, but a maturity of intelligence, a true insight into the meaning of life, a
                    nobility of imagination in union with a clearness and sanity of judgment, which
                    the most advanced eras of other literatures <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scarcely equal. Thus the two great Greek epics are unique in character, and,
                    while they have, in the highest degree, the excellences of each class, they can
                    properly be ranked under neither. While exhibiting, better than any other
                    writings, man and the outward world in ‘the first intention,’—man in the energy
                    and buoyancy of the national youth, and Nature in the vividness of impression
                    which she makes on the mind and sense in their most healthy activity,—they are
                    at the same time masterpieces of art and great monuments of the national mind.
                    The Greek imagination with no appearance of effort produced works of such
                    compass and harmonious proportion as only long years of labour and reflection in
                    collecting and combining materials in accordance with a predetermined purpose
                    produced in other literatures. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> We are not called upon to consider here the conditions out of which the earlier
                    type of epic poetry is developed, or to enquire why the Latin race failed to
                    create at least some inartistic legendary poem of sufficient length to be ranked
                    in that form of literature. Perhaps no answer could be given to the question
                    excepting that the Latin race had not sufficient creative force to produce such
                    a work,—which is simply another way of stating the fact that it did not produce
                    epic poems. The Romans were from a very early period interested in their past
                    history and traditions. They seem to have shaped, either out of real incidents
                    in their national and family history, or out of their chief national
                    characteristics, stories of strong human interest<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a>, which
                    only want the ‘vates sacer’ to be converted into poems. Every great family seems
                    to have had its own traditions, glorifying the exploits and preserving the
                    memory of illustrious ancestors; and whatever may have been the case in regard
                    to the legendary stories connected with the fortunes of the State, some of these
                    traditions were undoubtedly expressed in rude Saturnian verse, and chanted at
                    family gatherings and at funeral banquets. The memory of these ancestral
                    lays—if we may apply that word to them—survived till the time of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Cicero, Horace, and apparently even of Tacitus<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a>, though no actual trace of
                    them appears to have existed even in the age of the elder Cato. But the
                    influence of these rude germs of poetry—if they exercised any influence on
                    Latin literature at all—was confined to the structure of Roman history. An
                    enquiry into the origin and growth of Roman epic poetry need not concern itself
                    with them. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Neither is it necessary here to go back into the vexed and probably insoluble
                    question of the genesis of the Homeric poems. That these stand in most intimate
                    relation with the Virgilian epic is a patent fact; and the nature of this
                    intimate relation will be examined in some of the subsequent chapters. But they
                    first began to act on the Roman imagination and art many centuries after they
                    assumed their present form. The Romans accepted them as they did the lyrical and
                    dramatic poetry of Greece, and were absolutely unconcerned with the questions as
                    to their origin which interest modern curiosity. For the adequate understanding
                    of the form and substance of the Roman epic as it was shaped by its greatest
                    master, a competent knowledge of the Iliad and Odyssey must be presupposed; but
                    it is unnecessary in a work on Latin literature to discuss the origin and
                    character of the epic poetry of the Greeks on the same scale on which their
                    idyllic and didactic poetry has been discussed in previous chapters. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But just as historical composition, regarded as a branch of art, though
                    originating in the imitation of Greek models, has assumed in the works of Livy
                    and Tacitus a distinctively Roman type, in conformity with certain
                    characteristics of the race and with the weight of new matter which it has to
                    embody, so, too, the type of epic poetry realised by Virgil has acquired a
                    distinctive character as a vehicle of Roman sentiment and material. To
                    appreciate the native, as distinct from the foreign element in the mould in
                    which Virgil’s representation is cast, it is necessary to attend to certain
                    instincts and tendencies which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were calculated
                    strongly to affect any form of narrative poetry amongst the Romans, and also to
                    take a rapid survey of the history of their narrative poetry from the beginning
                    of their literature to the Augustan Age. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the first place, the strong national sentiment of Rome was a feeling which
                    could not fail to be appealed to in any works which aimed at securing both
                    general and permanent interest. The heroic story of Greece was indeed able for a
                    time to attract general attention at Rome from the novelty of the dramatic
                    representations in which it was introduced. But even Roman tragedy, to judge
                    from the testimony of Cicero and others, seems to have owed more of its
                    popularity to the grave spirit by which it was animated and the Roman strength
                    of will exhibited in its personages, than to the legitimate sources of interest
                    in a drama, viz. the play of human motives and the vicissitudes of human
                    fortunes. But to sustain the interest of a long narrative, as distinct from a
                    dramatic poem, it was necessary to act on some deep and general feeling. Not
                    only did the hearers require to be thus moved to attention, but the poet himself
                    could only thus be inspired and sustained in the unfamiliar task of literary
                    composition. Now, looking to other manifestations of Roman energy, we see that
                    whatever force was not employed on present necessities, was given, not as among
                    the Greeks to ideal creation, but to the commemoration of events of public
                    importance, and to the transmission of the lessons as well as of the history of
                    the passing time. The connexion between the past and the future was maintained
                    by monuments of different kinds, by public inscriptions, written annals, fasts,
                    or festivals recording some momentous experience in the history of the State.
                    All that we know and can still see of Roman work suggests the thought of a
                    people who had an instinctive consciousness of a long destiny; who built, acted,
                    and wrote with a view to a distant future. A national history was the legitimate
                    expression of this impulse; but before the language was developed into a form
                    suited for a continuous work in prose, it was natural that the tendency to
                    realise the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>past and hand down the memory of
                    the present should find an outlet for itself in various forms of narrative
                    poetry. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again, the Romans had a strong personal feeling of admiration for their great
                    men. They were animated by that generous passion to which, in modern times, the
                    term hero-worship has been applied. And corresponding with this feeling on the
                    part of his countrymen, there was in the object of it a strong love of glory, a
                    strong passion to perpetuate his name. Through the whole course of Roman history
                    we recognise this motive acting powerfully on the men most eminent in war,
                    politics, and literature, and on no one more powerfully than on the Emperor
                    Augustus. The memory of the great men of Rome and of their actions was kept
                    alive by monuments, statues, coins, waxen images preserved in the atrium of the
                    family house, by the poems sung and speeches delivered among funeral ceremonies,
                    by inscriptions on tombs (such as that still read on the tomb of Scipio
                    Barbatus), by family names (such as that of Africanus) derived from great
                    exploits, and, under the Empire, by the great triumphal arches and columns which
                    still excite the admiration of travellers. The Roman passion for glory received
                    its highest gratification in the triumph which celebrated great military
                    exploits. The culmination of the tendency to glorify actual living men, or men
                    recently dead, is witnessed in the deification of the Emperors. With the
                    development of literature we find, as we should expect, this tendency of the
                    imagination allying itself with poetry, from the time when Ennius devoted one
                    work to the celebration of Scipio down to the panegyrists of Augustus, Messala,
                    or Agrippa<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> under the early Empire. A new direction and a new motive
                    were thus given to narrative poetry—a direction and motive which had no
                    inconsiderable influence in determining Virgil to the choice of the subject of
                    the Aeneid. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Another characteristic of the race was likely to impress itself on the form and
                    execution of their narrative poetry, viz. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their
                    love of works of large compass and massive structure. Vastness of design and
                    solid workmanship are as distinctive properties of Roman art, as harmony of
                    proportion and beauty of form are of the works of Greek imagination. To compose
                    a literary work which should be representative of the genius of Rome, it was
                    necessary that the author should be not only imbued with Roman sentiment and
                    ideas, but also endowed with the Roman capacity for patient and persevering
                    industry. Concentration of purpose on works conceived and executed on a great
                    scale, with a view both to immediate and permanent results, was an essentially
                    Roman quality. The Romans built their aqueducts and baths for the commonest
                    needs of life, and constructed their roads and encampments, in such a way as to
                    astonish the world after the lapse of nearly two thousand years. With similar
                    energy and persistence of purpose they built up their greatest literary works.
                    This characteristic favoured the growth among them of a type of epic poetry as
                    distinct from that of Greece as the Coliseum was from the Parthenon. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If Roman epic poetry was not to be a mere imitation of the Greek epic, we should
                    accordingly expect that it should exhibit some or all of these
                    characteristics,—that it should seek that source of interest which secures
                    permanent attention to a long narrative poem in national sentiment; that it
                    should strive to restore the memory of the past history and traditions of the
                    State and at the same time to give expression to the ideas of the present time;
                    that it should magnify the greatness of eminent living men or of those who had
                    served their country before them; and that it should be conceived on a large
                    scale, and be executed perhaps with rude, but certainly with strong and massive
                    workmanship. The first original narrative poem in Latin literature—the Punic
                    War of Naevius—treated of a subject of living interest, and at the same time
                    glorified the mythical past of Rome; and, while rude in design and execution, it
                    was conceived and executed on a scale of large dimensions. The example was thus
                    given of a Roman epic based on a legendary foundation, but mainly built out of
                    the materials <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of contemporary history. We can
                    imagine that, at the time when this poem was composed, a more vivid interest
                    would be felt in the fictitious connexion between Rome and Troy from the fact
                    that it was in the First Punic War that this connexion appears first to have
                    been generally recognised. The legend had not as in Virgil’s time the prestige
                    of two centuries, but it had the force of novelty to recommend it for poetic
                    purposes. At the same time the great struggle between Rome and Carthage, on
                    which the attention of the world was fixed at the time when Naevius wrote, must
                    have given a peculiar meaning to the early relations between the two imperial
                    States, as they were first represented in his poem. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The poem of Naevius gave the germinative idea and some of the materials to the
                    first and fourth Books of the Aeneid; it established also the principle of
                    combining in one work a remote mythical past with a subject of strong
                    contemporary interest. At the same time it gave the example, followed by the
                    Roman national epic, before the time of Virgil, of taking the main subject of
                    the poem from the sphere of actual history. This confusion between the provinces
                    of poetry and prose had been avoided by the instinct of Greek taste. Among the
                    large number of Greek epic writers from the age of Homer to that of Nonnus, we
                    hear of only one or two who treated of actual historical events. The general
                    neglect of those poems which in ancient and modern times have treated of
                    historical events and characters in the forms of epic poetry shows that the
                    Greek instinct in this, as in all other questions of art, was unerringly right.
                    The choice and treatment of such a subject are equally fatal to the truth and
                    completeness of historical representation and to the ideality and unity of a
                    work of art. Though the objection does not equally apply to dramatic art, yet
                    the modern instinct, which selects for that mode of representation subjects
                    remote from our own times, confirms the judgment in accordance with which the
                    Athenians fined their tragic poet for reminding them of a too recent sorrow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Roman writers recognised the analogy between epic and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>historic narrative,—and the way in which they apprehended the
                    alliance between them was as injurious to the truthfulness of their history as
                    to the symmetry of their early poetry,—but they did not before the time of
                    Virgil recognise the artistic distinction between them. The Roman epic and Roman
                    history originated in the same feeling and impulse—the sentiment of national
                    glory, the desire to perpetuate the great actions and the career of conquest,
                    which were the constituent elements of that glory. The impulse both of poets and
                    historians was to build up a commemorative monument; not, as among the Greeks,
                    to present the spectacle of human life in its most animated, varied, and noble
                    movements. To a Roman historian and to a Roman poet the character and the fate
                    of individuals derived their chief interest from their bearing on the glory and
                    fortune of the State. In the Greek epic, on the other hand, the interest in
                    Achilles and Hector is much more vivid than that felt in the success of the
                    Greek or Trojan cause. In Herodotus the interest felt in the most important
                    historical crisis through which the world has ever passed is inseparably blended
                    with that felt in a great number of individual men, among the enemies of Greece,
                    no less than among Greeks themselves. In the History of Livy we do not expect to
                    find truthful delineation or sagacious analysis of the characters of the leading
                    men of Rome; still less do we expect to find impartial and sympathetic
                    delineation of the enemies of Rome; but we seek in his pages the image of the
                    nation’s life in its onward career of conquest and internal change, as pride and
                    affection shaped it on the tables of the national memory. The idea of Rome, as
                    the one object of supreme interest to gods and men, in the past, present, and
                    future, imparts the unity of sentiment, tone, and purpose which is
                    characteristic of the type of Roman epic poetry and of Roman history. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Naevius in selecting for his epic poem the subject of the First Punic War, and
                    in connecting that war with the events which were supposed to connect the Roman
                    State immediately with a divine origin and destiny, was the first Roman who was
                    moved <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to write by this powerful impulse. But
                    the man who first gave full expression to the national idea and feeling, who
                    first made Rome conscious of herself, and who was the true founder of her
                    literature, was Ennius. The title which he gave to his epic—Annales—perhaps
                    the most prosaic title ever given to a work of genius, indicates the character
                    of his work and his mode of treatment. The inspiration under which it was
                    written is more truly indicated by the other name—Romais—by which, according
                    to the testimony of an ancient grammarian<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a>, it was sometimes known. He took for his subject the whole
                    career of Rome, from its mythical beginning in the events which followed the
                    Trojan war onward to the latest events in his own day. The work was recognised
                    as a great epic poem, and at the same time fulfilled the part of a contemporary
                    chronicle. It was a true instinct of genius to feel that the only material
                    suitable for a Roman epic was to be sought in the idea of the whole national
                    life. That alone could supply the essential source of epic inspiration, the
                    sympathy between the poet and those to whom his poem is addressed, by which the
                    epic poet receives from, as well as gives back to, his audience. But on the
                    other hand, while he has the true poetic impulse,—the ‘vivida vis’ and the
                    strong conceptions of a poet,—he came too soon to acquire the tact and delicacy
                    of conception and execution equally essential to the creation of works destined
                    for immortality. The subject was too vast to be treated within the compass of a
                    poem, which demands to be read as a whole, and to be contemplated as one
                    continuous mental creation. The treatment of a long series of actions in
                    chronological order is incompatible with artistic effect; the treatment of
                    contemporary history is incompatible with the ideality of imaginative
                    representation. The workmanship of the poem, as exhibited in many fragments, is
                    powerful, but at the same time rude and unequal. Yet Ennius was a true
                    representative writer. He appealed powerfully to the national sentiment; he
                    revived the mythical and historic fame of the past; he perpetuated the memory
                    and interpreted the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>meaning of his own time; he
                    enhanced the glory of the great men and the great families of Rome; and he
                    produced a work of colossal proportions and massive execution. Till his place
                    was taken by a successor who united the fervour of a national poet to the
                    perfect workmanship of an artist, he was justly regarded as the truest
                    representative in literature of Roman character, sentiment, and ideas. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Other narrative and historical poems were known by the name of ‘Annales;’ one in
                    three Books, written by Accius, the tragic poet; another written by A. Furius of
                    Antium, which extended to a greater length, as Macrobius (ii. 1. 34<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a>) quotes from the tenth and the eleventh Books lines appropriated by
                    Virgil,—one of many proofs of the manner in which the genius of Virgil, acting
                    upon great reading, absorbed the thoughts and diction of his predecessors. The
                    most important of the historical poems which continued the mistake of treating
                    recent history in the form of a metrical chronicle appears to have been the
                    Istrian War of Hostius, the grandfather of the Cynthia of Propertius, and

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the earlier part of the Ciceronian Age, the decay of public spirit, and the
                    strong tendency which had set in of advancing individual claims above the
                    interest of the State, and of looking to individual leaders rather than to
                    established institutions, gave a new direction to narrative verse. The passion
                    for personal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>glory became the principal motive
                    of those poems which treated of recent or contemporary history. Eminent families
                    and individuals secured for themselves the services of poets, native or Greek.
                    Even before this time, Accius, as we learn from Cicero<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a>, was closely associated with D. Brutus, and it seems not
                    unlikely that the choice of the subject of one of his tragedies,—Brutus,—was
                    made as a compliment to his friend and patron. The Luculli and Metelli retained
                    the services of Archias, as their panegyrist,—a fact referred to by Cicero in
                    one of his letters to Atticus, not without a slight touch of jealousy<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>. Pompey was
                    served in the same way by Theophanes of Mitylene. The patronage of the great to
                    men of letters was thus by no means so disinterested as our first impressions
                    might lead us to suppose. Cicero himself with his extraordinary literary
                    activity wrote in his youth a poem on his townsman Marius, and failing to find
                    any other Greek or Roman to undertake the task, composed a poem in three Books
                    on his own Consulship<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a>, with a
                    result not fortunate to his reputation either for modesty or good taste. In a
                    letter to his brother Quintus, we find him encouraging him to the composition of
                    a poem on the Invasion of Britain by Julius Caesar. The passage is worth
                    attending to as indicating the materials out of which those poems which aimed at
                    celebrating contemporary events were framed:—‘What strange scenes, what
                    opportunities for describing things and places, what customs, tribes, battles.
                    What a theme too you have in your general himself<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a>!’ This passage may be compared with two
                    passages in Horace, showing that the same kind of thing was expected from a
                    poetical panegyrist under Augustus. The first of these is from Sat. ii. 1, lines

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He had served under Julius Caesar in Gaul, and wrote a poem on the war against
                    the Sequani in the traditional form. He also opened up to his countrymen that
                    vein of epic poetry which had been wrought by the Alexandrians. The most famous
                    poem of this kind in the literature of the Republic was the Jason of Varro,
                    imitated probably from the Argonautics of Apollonius. Propertius speaks of this
                    poem in a passage where he classes Varro also among the writers of amatory
                    poetry before his own time, such as Catullus, Cinna, Gallus, and Virgil in his
                    Eclogues:— </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He is thus as a writer of epic poems, on the one side, of the native school of
                    Ennius and the Annalists; on the other, he is the originator of that other type
                    of Roman epic which appears under the Empire in the Thebaid and Achilleid of
                    Statius and the Argonautics of Valerius Flaccus. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The two great poets of the later Ciceronian era introduced a great change into
                    Roman poetry,—the practice of careful composition. They are the first artistic
                    poets of Rome. The rapidity of composition which characterised all the earlier
                    writers was, in the rude state of the language at that time, incompatible with
                    high accomplishment. We read of Cicero writing five hundred hexameters in a
                    night, and of his brother Quintus writing four tragedies in sixteen days. The
                    true sense of artistic finish first appeared in Lucretius, and to a greater
                    degree in Catullus, and the younger men of the Ciceronian Age, Licinius Calvus,
                    Helvius Cinna, etc. The contempt with which the younger school regarded the old
                    fashion of composition appears in Catullus’ references—neither delicate nor
                    complimentary—to the ‘Annales Volusi,’ the ponderous annalistic epic of his
                    countryman (conterraneus) Tanusius Geminus<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>. But in this younger school, poetry
                    separated itself entirely from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the national
                    life, or dealt with it only in the form of personal epigrams on the popular
                    leaders and their partisans. The dignity of the hexameter was reserved by them
                    for didactic or philosophic poetry and short epic idyls treating of the heroic
                    legends of Greece. Didactic poetry, directing the attention to contemplation
                    instead of action, established itself as a successful rival to the old
                    historical epic, in the province of serious literature. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The latter, however, still found representatives in the following generation.
                    Thus Anser, the panegyrist of Antony, is familiarly known, owing to one of the
                    few satiric allusions which have been attributed to Virgil:— </p>

                </div>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Varius, with whom he is by implication contrasted in those lines, is
                    characterised by Horace as ‘Maeonii carminis ales,’ at a time when Virgil was
                    only famous as the poet of rural life. He was the author of a poem on the death
                    of Julius Caesar. We hear also of other specimens of the contemporary epic
                    produced in the Augustan Age, one by Cornelius Severus treating of the Sicilian
                    Wars, one by Rabirius treating of the Battle of Actium, and one by Pedo
                    Albinovanus treating of the voyage of Germanicus ‘per oceanum
                        septentrionalem<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a>.’ </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> We find Horace repeatedly excusing himself with self-disparaging irony, while
                    exhorting younger poets to the task of directly celebrating the wars of
                    Augustus,—e.g. Epist. i. 3. 7:— </p>

                </div>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Horace does indeed celebrate some of the military as well as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the peaceful successes of the Augustan Age, in the
                    only form in which contemporary or recent events admit of being poetically
                    treated, viz. lyrical poetry. But considering how eager Augustus was to have his
                    wars celebrated in verse and how strong in him was the national passion for
                    glory, and considering that Virgil and Horace were pre-eminently the favourite
                    poets of the time and the special friends both of the Emperor himself and his
                    minister, it is remarkable how they both avoid or defer the task which he wished
                    to impose on them. This reluctance arose from no inadequate appreciation of his
                    services to the world, but from their high appreciation of what was due to their
                    art. Virgil had been similarly importuned in earlier times by Pollio and Varus,
                    and had gracefully waived the claim made on him by pleading the fitness of his
                    own muse only for the lighter themes of pastoral poetry. He seems to have
                    hesitated long as to the form which the celebration of the glories of the
                    Augustan Age should take. How he solved the problem, how he sought to combine in
                    a work of Greek art the inspiration of the national epic with the personal
                    celebration of Augustus, will be treated of in the following chapter. </p>

                        the Aeneid are to be sought partly in his own literary position, partly in
                        the state of public feeling at the time when he commenced his task, and
                        partly in the direction given to his genius by the personal influence of
                        Augustus. As the author of the Georgics he had established his position as
                        the foremost poetic artist of his time. He had achieved a great success in a
                        great and serious undertaking. He had entered into competition with Greek
                        poets of acknowledged reputation, and had surpassed them in their own
                        province. He had accomplished all that could be accomplished by him as the
                        poet of the peaceful charm of country life. But while in his two earlier
                        works he limits himself to that field assigned to him by Horace,—that over
                        which the ‘gaudentes rure Camenae’ presided,—the stirring of a larger

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He had yet to find a fuller expression for his sympathy with his age, which
                        had deepened with the deepening significance of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>times, and for that interest in the contemplation of human
                        life which becomes the dominant influence in all great poets whose faculty
                        ripens with advancing years. He might still aspire to be the Homer, as he
                        had proved himself to be the Theocritus and the Hesiod of his country. The
                        rudeness of the work of Ennius, the limited and temporary scope of the works
                        of Varius—his only competitor in epic song,—left that place still
                        unappropriated. Virgil’s whole previous career prepared him to be the author
                        of a poem of sustained elevation and elaborate workmanship. The composition
                        of the Georgics had trained his faculty of continuous exposition and of
                        massing together a great variety of details towards a common end. It had
                        given him a perfect mastery over the only vehicle suitable to the dignity of
                        epic poetry. He had indeed still to put forth untried capacities—the
                        faculties of dealing with the passions and movement of human life as he had
                        dealt with the sentiment and movement of Nature, of expressing thought and
                        feeling dramatically and oratorically, and of imparting living interest to
                        the actions and fortunes of imaginary personages. But he was now in the
                        maturity of his powers. He had long lived with the single purpose of
                        perfecting himself in art and knowledge. He had no other ambition but to
                        produce some great work, which should perpetuate his own fame, and be a
                        monument of his country’s greatness. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The completion of the Georgics and the first conception of the Aeneid
                        coincided in point of time with the event which not only established a sense
                        of security in the room of the long strain of alarm and anxiety and a sense
                        of national unity in the room of internecine strife in the Roman world, but
                        which, to those looking back upon it after nineteen centuries, appears to be
                        one of the most critical turning-points in all history. The enthusiasm of
                        the moment found expression by the voice of Horace:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Virgil represents more truly the deeper tendencies of his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>age than the poet who has most faithfully painted
                        its social aspects. He looks beyond the temporary triumph and sense of
                        relief, and sees in the victory of Actium the culminating point of all the
                        past history of Rome and the starting point of a greater future. There had
                        been no time since the final defeat of Hannibal so calculated to re-awaken
                        the sense of national life, of the mission to subdue and govern the world
                        assigned to Rome, and of the divine guardianship of which she was the
                        object. As the joy of a great success had found a representative voice in
                        Ennius in the age when the State, relieved from all overwhelming danger,
                        started on its career of foreign conquest, so it found as deep and true a
                        voice in Virgil at the time when the relief, if not from as imminent a
                        danger, yet certainly from a much longer strain of anxiety, left Rome free
                        to consolidate her many conquests into a vast and orderly Empire. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In both the Eclogues and Georgics it was seen that Virgil allows his genius
                        to be in some measure directed by others in the choice of his subjects,
                        while he follows his own judgment in his mode of treating them. In the
                        earlier poems he acknowledges the direction given to him both by Varus and
                        by Pollio,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> while at the same time he excuses himself from directly celebrating their
                        actions. In the Georgics he describes his task as being commanded by
                        Maecenas—‘tua, Maecenas, haud mollia iussa.’ The desire of Augustus,
                        whether openly expressed or not, to commemorate his success and to add
                        lustre to his rule by associating them with the noblest art of his age, must
                        have acted with more imperious urgency on the will of Virgil than the wishes
                        of any of his earlier patrons. His patriotic and personal feeling to the
                        saviour of the State and his own benefactor must have made the task imposed
                        on him a service of love as well as of obligation. But in undertaking this
                        task he desired to make it subservient to the purpose of producing a work
                        which should emulate the greatest poetical works of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Greeks, and which should, at the same time, be a true symbol
                        of Rome at the zenith of her fortunes. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil had now found in his own age a motive for the composition of that
                        epic poem which it had been his boyish ambition to attempt,— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He could appeal as Ennius, or even as Homer had done, to hearers animated by
                        the same feeling which moved himself. The two great conditions of a work of
                        art which should gain the ear of the world immediately, and which should
                        interest it permanently, were prepared for him in the enthusiasm of the
                        moment, and in the enduring interest attaching to the career of Rome. His
                        highly-trained faculty, already proved and exercised in other works, was a
                        guarantee for the artistic execution of any design which he should
                        undertake. But two questions remained for him to solve,—what form should
                        his epic poem assume? should he follow absolutely the precedent of Homer, or
                        of Ennius, or endeavour to surpass the contemporary panegyrists like Varius
                        by a direct celebration of the events of his age? And if he adopted the
                        Homeric type, what subject should he adopt so as to impart the interest of
                        personal fortunes and human character to a poem the inspiring motive of
                        which was the national idea? </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The problem which Virgil set before himself was really one altogether new in
                        literature. The Alexandrian Age had endeavoured to revive an interest in the
                        heroic adventure of early or mythical times. It had recognised the principle
                        that this distant background was essential to a poem of heroic action, and
                        that events of contemporary or recent history were not capable of epic
                        treatment. But it had not discerned the necessary supplement to that
                        principle, that if such a poem, on a large scale, is to gain a permanent
                        place in literature, it must bear some immediate relation to the age in
                        which it is written, and be associated with some ethical and religious
                        truths or some political cause of vital importance to the world. The epic
                        poet <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a cultivated age can maintain his
                        place as a great artist only by being something more than an artist. He must
                        feel more strongly than others, and give expression to the deepest
                        tendencies of his own time. His subject must be charged with the force of
                        the present, and not be mere material for the exercise of his imitative
                        faculty. Virgil might, merely as an artist, have easily surpassed the Jason
                        of Varro, or the Thebaid of Statius; but no technical skill in form,
                        diction, and rhythm could have given to his treatment of such subjects the
                        immediate attraction or the enduring spell which belongs to the Aeneid. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Both Ennius and Naevius had set the example of connecting a continuous
                        narrative of the events of their own time with the mythical glories and the
                        traditional history of Rome. And the Introduction to the third Georgic
                        indicates that some idea of this kind at one time hovered before the
                        imagination of Virgil. But while moved by the same patriotic impulses as
                        these older poets, Virgil must have felt as strongly as Horace did that they
                        were examples to be avoided in the choice of form and mode of treatment. He
                        and Horace acknowledged the Greeks alone as their masters in art. He aspires
                        not only to surpass Ennius and Naevius in the office they fulfilled, but to
                        enter into rivalry with Homer,—to perform for the Romans of the Augustan
                        Age a work analogous to that which Homer performed for the Greeks of his
                        age. To do this, it was necessary to select some single heroic action from
                        the cycle of mythical events, and to connect that with the whole story of
                        Rome and Italy and with the events of the Augustan Age. The action had in
                        some way to illustrate or symbolise the thoughts, memories, and hopes with
                        which public feeling was identified at the time when the poem was written.
                        Thus the original motive of the Virgilian epic was essentially different
                        from that of the Homeric poems. The Iliad and the Odyssey have their origin
                        in the pure epic impulse. The germ of the poems is the story; their purpose
                        is to satisfy the curiosity felt in human action and character. The ‘wrath
                        of Achilles,’ the ‘return of Odysseus,’ are, as they profess to be, the
                        primary sources of interest in the poems <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>founded on them; the representative character of the poems, like the
                        representative character of Shakspeare’s historical dramas, is accidental
                        and undesigned. The germ of the Aeneid, on the other hand, is to be sought
                        in the national idea and sentiment, in the imperial position of Rome, in her
                        marvellous destiny, and in its culmination in the Augustan Age. The actions
                        and sufferings of the characters that play their part in the poem were to be
                        only secondary objects of interest; the primary object was to be found in
                        the race to whose future career these actions and sufferings were the
                        appointed means. The real key-note to the poem is not the ‘Arma virumque’
                        with which it opens, but the ‘Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a>’ with which the exordium closes. The choice and conduct of
                        the action were the mechanical difficulties to be overcome by the poet, not
                        the inspiring motives of his genius. This is the main cause of the
                        comparative tameness of the Aeneid in point of human interest. Actors and
                        action did not spring out of the spontaneous movement of the imagination,
                        but were chosen by a refined calculation to fulfil the end which Virgil had
                        in view. What Aeneas and his followers want in personal interest, is
                        supposed to accrue to them as instruments in the hands of destiny. A new
                        type of epic poetry is thus realised. The Iliad and the Odyssey are
                        essentially poems of personal, the Aeneid is the epic of national fortunes.

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Had Virgil’s sole object been to write a national epic which should satisfy
                        popular sentiment, we can imagine several reasons why the tale of Romulus
                        should have been chosen as its subject in preference to that of Aeneas.
                        Though the traditional account of the founder of the city owes some of its
                        features to Greek invention, yet it has a much more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">naïve</span></span> and indigenous character than that of the Trojan settlement in
                        Latium. It was more firmly rooted in the popular mind. It was still
                        celebrated, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as we learn from Dionysius, in
                        national hymns. It had been commemorated in a famous work of art, the bronze
                        she-wolf still extant, at a time antecedent to the origin of Roman
                        literature. It formed the chief subject of the first book of the Annals of
                        Ennius, which, as dealing with the mythical portion of his theme, seems to
                        have had more of an epic character than the later books. It was also a
                        subject which by its relation to famous localities and memorials of the
                        past,—such as the oldest city-wall, the Ruminal fig-tree, the temple of
                        Jupiter Stator, the Palatine and Aventine hills,—and with the religious and
                        social organisation of the State, admitted easily of being connected with
                        the present time. It might have been so treated as to magnify the glory of
                        the Emperor, who desired to be regarded as the second founder of the city,
                        and is said to have debated whether he should not assume the title of
                        Romulus, before deciding on taking that of Augustus. A poet of bolder and
                        more original invention, and one more capable of sympathising with the
                        purely martial characteristics of his hero, might have been attracted by
                        this story of indigenous growth rather than by the exotic legend on which
                        Virgil has bestowed such enduring life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That legend seems, at first sight, to fail in the elements both of national
                        and human interest. It was mainly of Greek invention. It seems to have been
                        received by the Romans at a later stage in their development than that in
                        which religious or legendary beliefs strike deep root in the popular
                        imagination. It existed in vague and indistinct shape, and was associated
                        with no marked individuality of personages or incidents. It was of composite
                        growth, made up of many incongruous elements, the product rather of
                        antiquarian learning and reflexion than of creative imagination. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Greek germ out of which the legend arose, and the acceptance of this
                        explanation of their origin by the Romans from the beginning of their
                        literary history, are clearly ascertained. But there is great uncertainty as
                        to the connecting link between these two stages in the development of the
                        legend. The continuance of the line of Aeneas after the destruction of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Troy is announced by the mouth of Poseidon

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If an historical character may be assigned to any passages in the Iliad, it
                        may be presumed that the author of these verses knew of a line of princes
                        ruling over some remnant of the Trojans, and claiming Aeneas as their
                        ancestor. But these verses do not imply any removal to a distant settlement.
                        The Cyclic poet, Arctinus, next spoke of Aeneas as retiring to Mount Ida and
                        founding a city there. The earliest traditions accordingly point to the
                        Troad as the scene of the rule of his descendants: other traditions however,
                        which must have been known to Virgil, brought him to Thrace, to various
                        places on the Aegean, and to Buthrotum in Epirus. The origin of these
                        traditions is believed to be the connexion of Aeneas with the worship of
                        Aphrodite, which was widely spread over the Mediterranean, probably as a
                        survival of early Phoenician settlements. This connexion in worship is
                        supposed to have arisen from a confusion between the Trojan hero and the
                        title <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Αἴνεας</span></span>, denoting one of the attributes of the goddess. But
                        the writer who first gave the idea of a Trojan settlement in Italy is said
                        to have been Stesichorus, the lyrical poet of Himera in Sicily, who
                        flourished about the beginning of the sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> One of the representations in the Ilian table in the

                        they are on the point of embarking on board their ship. The following

The motive actuating Stesichorus was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>probably the desire to connect the
                        newly-discovered localities in Italy and Sicily with the cycle of Homeric
                        narrative. But Stesichorus apparently knew nothing of a Trojan settlement in
                        Latium; Siris in Oenotria seems to have been fixed on by him as the place of
                        refuge for the Palladium and the Penates of Troy. It was after the
                        destruction of Siris that the fancy of the Greeks fixed on Lavinium, where
                        there was a worship similar to that established at Siris, as the ultimate
                        resting-place of Aeneas. The first definite statement connecting Rome with
                        Troy was made by Cephalon of Gergis in the Troad (about 350 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>), who ascribed the foundation of the city to
                        Romus a son of Aeneas. In the course of the next half century this appears
                        to have become the prevailing belief among the Greeks, whose attention was
                        now attracted by the growing ascendency of Rome in Italy. About the
                        beginning of the third century Timaeus, the Sicilian historian, is said to
                        have shaped the legend into the form adopted by Naevius<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is obvious that there is a great gap in our knowledge of the stages in
                        the development of the legend between Stesichorus, a poet of the sixth
                        century, and Cephalon, an historian of the fourth. And the question suggests
                        itself whether, in the interval between them, the Romans themselves had
                        accepted any similar explanation of their origin. The early connexion
                        between Rome and Cumae renders it not impossible that the Romans had formed
                        some idea of their Trojan descent, before the wars of Pyrrhus brought them
                        into more intimate connexion with the Greeks. It was by the Greek colonists
                        of Cumae that the Isles of the Sirens, the Kingdom of the Laestrygones, and
                        the abode of Circe were localised near Sorrento, the ancient town of
                        Formiae, and the promontory of Circeii. It seems probable that to them also
                        may be ascribed the mythical connexion established between the promontories
                        of Caieta, Misenum, and Palinurum, in their own immediate neighbourhood,
                        with the names of the household or followers of Aeneas. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mythical traditions which assign a Greek origin to
                        various important Latin towns, such as Tibur, Tusculum, Praeneste, and to
                        the earliest settlement on the Palatine Hill, probably owe their invention
                        to the same source. Alba Longa, as the chief city of the old Latin
                        confederacy, must have been an object of greater interest to the Cumaeans
                        than Tibur or Tusculum, and if we could be sure of the existence of the
                        belief in the Trojan settlement in Latium before the destruction of Alba, we
                        might infer with probability the great antiquity of the legend which
                        ascribed the foundation of that town to the son of Aeneas. This belief might
                        easily have passed to Rome; and Cephalon may have received it, in a somewhat
                        distorted form, from native sources. But it is impossible to take any step
                        in these conjectures without feeling the extreme uncertainty of our ground.
                        We really know nothing of the acceptance of this account of their origin by
                        the Romans before the time of the First Punic War; it is not easily
                        reconcileable with the indigenous belief which certainly struck much deeper
                        roots in the national history: the story as told by Cephalon appears to
                        exclude the connexion between Rome and Alba as an intermediate link in that
                        between Rome and Troy. It seems, on the whole, most probable that the story
                        on which the Aeneid is founded is not only a Greek invention, but is an
                        invention of a late and prosaic time, and was not known to the Romans before
                        the date of their wars with Pyrrhus<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But besides the foreign and prosaic origin of the story, there is great
                        vagueness and indistinctness in the incidents and personages connected with
                        it. Homer indeed has supplied a definite, though not a marked, outline to
                        the character of Aeneas; and Stesichorus, in shaping the family group of
                        Anchises, Aeneas, and Ascanius flying from Troy with their household-gods,
                        may have suggested to Virgil the leading characteristic of his hero. But
                        these were nearly all the elements in the legend derived from primitive
                        poetical sources. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>There was no
                        individuality of character attaching to any of the followers of Aeneas, nor
                        any incident due to early imaginative invention associated with the dim
                        tradition of his wanderings. The story, as finally cast into shape by
                        Virgil, is one of composite growth, made up of many heterogeneous
                        elements,—some supplied by poetical invention and the impressions of a
                        primitive time, some the products of prosaic rationalism and the antiquarian
                        fancies of a literary age, some suggested by Greek mythology and others by
                        the ritual observances of Rome, some directly borrowed from the Homeric
                        poems, others derived from the traditions of ancient Italy. It need hardly
                        surprise us if out of such indistinct and heterogeneous materials Virgil
                        failed to shape a thoroughly consistent and lifelike representation of human
                        action and character. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, on other grounds, the judgment of Virgil may be justified in the choice
                        of this legend, vague, composite, and unpoetical as it was, as most adapted
                        to his own genius and to the purpose of his epic poem. It was the only
                        subject, of national significance, connected with the Homeric cycle of
                        events. Not only the epic and dramatic poets of Greece, but the Roman tragic
                        poets had recognised the heroic legends of Greece as the legitimate material
                        for those forms of poetry which aimed at representing human action and
                        character with seriousness and dignity. The personages and events connected
                        with the Trojan War had especially been made familiar to the Romans by the
                        works of their early dramatic poets. The Romans themselves had no mythical
                        back-ground, rich in poetic associations, to their own history. It was
                        impossible for a poet of a literary age to create this back-ground. But it
                        was possible for him to give substance and reality to the shadowy connexion,
                        existing in legend and in the works of older national writers, between the
                        beginnings of Roman history and this distant region of poetry and romance.
                        Virgil’s imagination, as was seen in the examination of the Georgics, was
                        peculiarly susceptible of the impressions produced by a remote antiquity and
                        by old poetic associations. If he was deficient in spon<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>taneous invention, he possessed a remarkable power of giving
                        new life to the creations of earlier times. Next to the invention of a new
                        world of wonder and adventure,—a work most difficult of accomplishment in a
                        late stage of human development,—the most attractive aim which an epic poet
                        could set before himself was that of reviving, under new conditions and with
                        an immediate reference to the feelings of his contemporaries, an image of
                        the old Homeric life. The subject of the wanderings and subsequent
                        adventures of Aeneas enabled Virgil to tell again, and from a new point of
                        view, the old story of the fall of Troy, to present a modern version of the
                        sea-adventures of the Odyssey, and to awaken the interest of a nation of
                        soldiers in the martial passions of an earlier and ruder age. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Although there is no evidence that the connexion of Rome with Troy had sunk
                        deeply into the popular mind before the time of Virgil, yet it had been
                        recognised in official acts of the State for more than two centuries. So
                        early as the First Punic War the Acarnanians had applied to the Romans for
                        assistance against the Aetolians, on the ground that their ancestors alone
                        among the Greeks had taken no part in the Trojan War. The Senate had offered
                        alliance and friendship to King Seleucus on condition of his exempting the
                        people of Ilium, as kinsmen of the Romans, from tribute<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a>. T. Flamininus, in declaring
                        all the Greeks free after the conclusion of the Second Macedonian War,
                        described himself as one of the Aeneadae<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href="#note_461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a>. In the Second Punic War, the prophet Marcius uses the word

                        recognised. His own worship also established itself in the religion of the
                        State by his identification with Jupiter Indiges, who seems to have had a
                        temple on the banks of the river Numicius. Many families among the Roman
                        aristocracy, as for instance the Cluentii, Sergii, Memmii<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a>, claimed to be descended from the followers of
                        Aeneas. From the time of Naevius this account of the origin of the Romans
                        had been the accepted belief in all Latin literature. Ennius begins his
                        annals from the date </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The poet Accius had written a tragedy called Aeneadae. The Roman annalists
                        started with the tradition as an accepted fact. Thus Livy in reference to
                        this belief uses the expression ‘it is sufficiently established.’ The great
                        antiquarian Varro wrote a treatise on the Trojan origin of Roman families.
                        Cicero in his Verrine orations (act. ii. 4. 33) speaks of the relationship
                        of the people of Segesta in Sicily, which claimed to be a colony founded by
                        Aeneas, with the Roman people. Even Lucretius, who stands apart from the
                        general traditional beliefs of his countrymen, begins his poem with the
                        words ‘Aeneadum genetrix.’ Virgil’s poem appealed not to the popular taste,
                        but to the national, religious, aristocratic, and literary sympathies of the
                        cultivated classes. The legend of Aeneas, if less ancient and less popular,
                        assigned a more august origin to the Roman race than the tale of the birth
                        of Romulus:— </p>

                        most suitable symbol of the idea of Rome, from both a national and religious
                        point of view. But the circumstance which must have absolutely determined
                        his choice was the claim which the Julian gens made to be directly descended
                        from Iulus, Aeneas, and the goddess Venus. This claim Virgil had already
                        acknowledged in the line (Ecl. ix. 47), </p>

                        taking the words ‘Venus Victrix’ for his watchword at the battle of
                        Pharsalia. A greater tribute was paid to the qualities of Augustus, a more
                        august consecration was conferred on his rule, by representing that rule as
                        a prominent object in the counsels of Heaven a thousand years before its

                        and individual character associated with it were conditions unfavourable to
                        novelty and vividness of representation, yet they allowed to Virgil great
                        latitude in carrying out his purpose of giving body and substance to all
                        that unknown and shadowy past, which survived only in names, customs, and
                            cere<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>monies. He was not limited to any
                        particular district or period. His plan enabled him to embrace in the
                        compass of his epic the dim traditions connected with the ‘origins’ of the
                        famous towns and tribes of Central Italy and of several of the great Roman
                        families; it enabled him to imagine the primitive state of places which had
                        a world-wide celebrity in his own time; to invoke, as an element of poetic
                        interest, the veneration paid to the ancient rites of religion; and to cast
                        an idealising light on events, personages, families, or customs familiar to
                        his own age, by associating them with the sentiment of an immemorial past.
                        One great excellence of the Aeneid, as a representative poem, is the large
                        prospect of Roman and Italian life which it opens up before us. The vague
                        outlines of the story which he followed enabled Virgil to enlarge his
                        conception with an ampler content of local and national material, than if he
                        had been called upon to recast a more definite and more vital tradition. The
                        want of individuality in the personages of his story justified him in
                        exhibiting their character in accordance with his own ideal; in conceiving
                        of Aeneas as the type of antique piety combined with modern humanity, and of
                        Turnus as the type of the haughty and martial spirit, animating the old
                        Italian race. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Even the composite character of the legend and the heterogeneous elements
                        out of which it was composed, if unfavourable to unity of impression and
                        simplicity of execution, conduced to the poet’s purpose of concentrating in
                        one representation, of a Roman vastness of compass, whatever might enhance
                        and illustrate the greatness of Rome and of its ruler. The Rome of the
                        Augustan Age no longer exhibited the political and religious unity of an old
                        Italian republic; it was expanding its limits so as to embrace in a much
                        wider unity the various nations that had played their part in the past
                        history of the world. As the glory and wealth of Asia, Greece, Carthage,
                        etc. had all gone to swell the glory and wealth of Rome, so all the
                        traditions, historic memories, and literary art of the past were to be made
                        tributary to her national representative poem. The first great epic poem of
                        the ancient world is buoyant with the promise of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the mighty life which was to be; the last great epic is
                        weighty with the accumulated experience of all that had been. The stream of
                        epic poetry shows no longer the jubilant force and purity of
                        waters—‘exercita cursu flumina’—which rise in the high mountain-land
                        separating barbarism from civilisation; it moves more slowly and less
                        clearly through more level and cultivated districts; its volume is swollen
                        and its weight increased by tributaries which have never known the ‘bright

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> These considerations lead to the conclusion that the legend of Aeneas was
                        better suited than any other which he could have selected for the two
                        objects which Virgil had before his mind in the composition of the Aeneid;
                        first, that of writing a poem representative and commemorative of Rome and
                        of his own epoch, in the spirit in which some of the great architectural
                        works of the Empire, such as the Column of Trajan, the Arches of Titus and
                        of Constantine, were erected; and, secondly, that of writing an imitative
                        epic of action, manners, and character which should afford to his countrymen
                        an interest analogous to that which the Greeks derived from the Homeric
                        poems. The knowledge necessary to enable him to fulfil the first purpose was
                        contained in such works as the ceremonial books of the various Priestly
                        Colleges, the ‘Origines’ of Cato, the antiquarian treatise of Varro, and
                        perhaps the ‘Annales’ and ‘Fasti<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>’ which preserved the record of national and family
                        traditions. In giving life to these dry materials his mind was animated by
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the spectacle of Rome, and the thought
                        of her wide empire, her genius, character, and history; by the visible
                        survivals of ancient ceremonies and memorials of the past; by the sight of
                        the great natural features of the land, of old Italian towns of historic
                        renown, or, where they had disappeared, of the localities still marked by
                        their name:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As poetic sources of inspiration for this part of his task Virgil had the
                        national epic poems of Naevius and Ennius; and of both of these he made use:
                        of the first, in his account of the storm which drives Aeneas to Carthage
                        and of his entertainment there by the Carthaginian Queen; of the second, by
                        his use of many half-lines and expressions which give an antique and stately
                        character to the description of incidents or the expression of sentiment.
                        For Virgil’s other purpose, his chief materials were derived from his
                        intimate familiarity with the two great Homeric poems: but he availed
                        himself also of incidents contained in the Homeric Hymns, in the Cyclic
                        poems, in the Greek Tragedies, as for instance the lost Laocoon of
                        Sophocles, and in the Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius. His own experience
                        of life, and still more the insight which his own nature afforded him into
                        various moods of passion, affection, and chivalrous emotion, enabled him to
                        impart novelty and individuality to the materials which he derived from
                        these foreign and ancient sources. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A minute examination of the various books of the poem would bring out
                        clearly that these two objects, that of raising a monument to the glory of
                        Rome and of Augustus, and that of writing an imitative epic reproducing some
                        image of the manners and life of the heroic age, were present to the mind of
                        Virgil through his whole undertaking. It will be sufficient in order to show
                        this two-fold purpose to look at the first book, and at some of the more
                        prominent incidents in the later books. </p>

                        by sea and land, determined by the personal agency of some of the old
                        Olympian gods (‘vi superum’). The scope of the Aeneid as explained in these
                        lines is however wider than that of the Odyssey, as embracing the warlike
                        action of the Iliad as well as a tale of sea-adventure. But in the statement

                        is apparent. The wanderings of Odysseus have no other aim than a safe return

                        the spirit and life of the ‘novitas florida mundi.’ The greatness of Aeneas
                        is a kind of ‘imputed’ greatness; he is important to the world as bearing

                        purpose and affection, loyalty to his comrades, versatility, ready resource;

                        his adventure; he ends his career as he begins it, the chief of a small
                        island, which derives all its importance solely from its early association

                        the Divine beings by whose agency the action is advanced or impeded. As in
                        the opening paragraph Virgil had the opening lines of the Odyssey in view,

                        action of the poem, its inner relation to the future fulfilment of the Roman
                        destiny, its more immediate dependence on the past events forming the
                        subject of the Homeric poems. The prominence in Virgil’s mind of the Roman
                        over the Greek influences, in which his epic had its origin, is indicated by
                        the position and weight of the line of cardinal significance— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In entering on the detailed narrative, which forms the main body of the
                        poem, Virgil at once attaches himself to Homer. The action, like the action
                        of the Odyssey, is taken up at that stage immediately preceding the events
                        of most critical interest, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>after which it
                        advances steadily to the final catastrophe. The slower movement of the story
                        in the years between the fall of Troy and the departure from Sicily is
                        presupposed, and, like the adventures of Odysseus before his departure from
                        the Isle of Calypso, the adventures of Aeneas are subsequently narrated by
                        the principal actor in them. The storm which drives the Trojan fleet to the
                        Carthaginian coast was an incident in the epic of Naevius; but the original
                        suggestion and the actual description of it are due to the account of the
                        storm raised by Poseidon in the fifth book of the Odyssey. Juno, in availing
                        herself of the instrumentality of Aeolus, bribes him by a promise similar to
                        that made to Sleep in the fourteenth book of the Iliad. The description of
                        the harbour in which the Trojan ships find refuge is imitated from that of
                        the harbour to which the Phaeacian ship brings Odysseus; and the success of
                        Aeneas in the chase is suggested by two passages in the Odyssey, ix. 154 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span> and x. 104 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>

                        poem in which the action is prophetically advanced into the Augustan Age.
                        These three passages (i. 223–296, vi. 756–860, viii. 626–731), like the
                        greater episodes of the Georgics, draw attention directly to what is the
                        most vital and most permanent source of interest in the Aeneid. They serve,
                        along with the opening lines of the poem, better than any other passages to
                        bring out the relation both of dependence on the Homeric epic and of
                        contrast with it which characterise the Virgilian epic. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The passage before us, the interview between Jupiter and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Venus, owes its original suggestion to the scene
                        in the first book of the Iliad in which Thetis intercedes with Zeus, to
                        avenge the wrong done to her son. The object of this intercession is a
                        purely personal one; the result of it is the whole series of events which
                        culminates in the death of Hector. The object which Venus claims of Jupiter
                        is the fulfilment of his promise that a people should arise from the blood
                        of Teucer— </p>

                        monument of the race which during the longest period of history has played
                        the greatest part in human affairs. The old gods of Olympus appear on earth
                        once more, and now with all the attributes of Roman state, as
                        ‘principalities and powers’ contending for the empire of the world, and as
                        instruments in the hands of destiny for the furthering of the great work
                        which was only fully accomplished by Augustus. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the recital of the fall of Troy, which occupies the second book, Virgil
                        is said by Macrobius to have adhered almost verbally<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> to the work of a Greek poet, Pisander, the author of a
                        poetical history of the world from the marriage of Jupiter and Juno down to
                        the events contemporary with the poet himself. There seem to have been three
                        Greek poets of that name, and the only one of them who was likely to have
                        treated at any length of the events of that single night recorded in the
                        second Aeneid is said to have lived after the time of Virgil. It seems
                        impossible that any earlier poet could have assigned so much space as that
                        demanded by the statement of Macrobius to the personal adventures of Aeneas.
                        We are on surer ground in recognising the debt which Virgil owed to the
                        account of the wooden horse in the Odyssey, to some of the lost plays of
                        Sophocles, which told the tale of the treachery of Sinon and of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the tragic fate of Laocoon, and to some of the
                        lost Cyclic poems and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Ἰλίου πέρσις</span></span> of Stesichorus. The vision
                        of Hector to Aeneas reminds us of that of Patroclus to Achilles; but in this
                        resemblance we recognise also the difference between the poem founded on
                        personal and that founded on national fortunes. The care which summons the
                        shade of Patroclus to the couch of his friend is the care for his own
                        burial; the care which brings Hector back to earth is the care for the
                        salvation of the sacred relics of Troy in view of the great destiny which
                        awaited them. There is more of human pathos in the vision of Patroclus; more
                        of a stately majesty in that of Hector. And as in other passages where
                        Virgil wishes to produce this effect, we note that he avails himself here of
                        the language of Ennius,— </p>

                        historians, who rationalised the traditions of the various settlements of
                        Aeneas which grew out of his association with the worship of Aphrodite. But
                        the whole suggestion of sea-adventure, and still more of the incidents
                        arising out of the visit to the land of the Cyclops, is due to the Odyssey,
                        while the events connected with the landing in Thrace and in Epirus owe
                        their origin to the Hecuba and Andromache of Euripides. But, on the other
                        hand, the exact geographical knowledge displayed in it imparts a thoroughly
                        modern character to the book; and one passage at least (as has been shown by
                        a writer in the Journal of Philology)—the description of the voyage round
                        the eastern and southern shores of Sicily—is so minutely accurate in detail
                        as to give clear indication of being drawn from the personal experience of
                        the author. Again, the frequent mention of Italy in the book, the speech of
                        Helenus which announces the old traditional omen of the white sow, the
                        direction as to the mode of performing religious ceremonies which the Romans
                        should observe in all future times,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> and the trophy raised by Aeneas on the shores of Actium, help to remind us
                        of the modern meaning which Virgil desired to impart to his representation
                        of antique manners. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The fourth book, in which Virgil deserts the guidance of Homer for that of
                        the Alexandrine epic, is intended to give the most passionate human, as
                        distinct from the pervading national, interest to the poem. But the tragic
                        nature of the situation arises from the clashing between natural feeling and
                        the great considerations of State by which the divine actors in the drama
                        were influenced. The death of Dido gives moreover a poetical justification
                        for the deadly enmity which animated the struggle between Rome and her most
                        dangerous antagonist. The fifth book follows the old tradition—as old at
                        least as the time of Thucydides—which represented Trojan settlements as
                            estab<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lished in Sicily. The account of
                        the foundation of Segesta by the followers of Aeneas, and the story of the
                        burning of the ships by the Trojan women, may have been told by Timaeus; and
                        it was natural to ascribe to her son the building of the famous temple of
                        Venus Erycina. But the greater part of the book is occupied with an account
                        of the funeral games in honour of Anchises, which, with modifications to
                        suit the changed locality, reproduce the games which Achilles celebrated in
                        honour of Patroclus. But the account of these games serves the purpose of
                        giving some individuality to three of the most shadowy personages in the
                        poem by establishing their connexion with three illustrious Roman families,
                        and to flatter Augustus by assigning an ancient origin to the Ludus
                        Troiae,—a kind of bloodless tournament of noble youths exhibited in the
                        early years of his reign,—and also, by the invention of a fabulous
                        ancestor, to add distinction to the provincial family of the Atii, which was
                        more truly ennobled by the great personal qualities of the Emperor’s mother,
                        Atia. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With the landing in Italy the narrative assumes greater independence. The
                        various localities introduced and the traditions connected with them, the
                        usages or ceremonies peculiar to Italy which admit of being referred to an
                        immemorial past, the mere Italian names of Latinus and Turnus, Mezentius and
                        Camilla, are able to evoke national and sometimes modern associations. Thus
                        the introduction of the Cumaean Sibyl into the narrative affords the
                        opportunity of reminding the Romans of the importance assigned to the
                        Sibylline prophecies in their national counsels; and the impressive ceremony
                        of the opening of the gates of war enables the poet to appeal to the
                        patriotic impulses of his own age, in the lines— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But many of the warlike incidents in the later books—as for instance the
                        night foray of Nisus and Euryalus, the treacherous wounding of Aeneas, the
                        withdrawal by supernatural agency of Turnus from the battle, the death of
                        Pallas and the effect which that event has on Aeneas, and the final conflict
                        between Turnus and Aeneas—show that Virgil was still following in the
                        footsteps of his original guide. The passages, however, which bring out most
                        clearly both this relation of Virgil to Homer and his point of departure
                        from him are those which give an account of the descent into hell and
                        describe the shield of Aeneas. The sixth book of the Aeneid owes its
                        existence to the eleventh book of the Odyssey: but the shadowy conceptions
                        of the Homeric ‘Inferno,’ suggested by the impulses of natural curiosity and
                        the yearnings of human affection, are enlarged and made more definite, on
                        the one hand, by thoughts derived from Plato, and, on the other, by the
                        proudest memories of Roman history, from the legends of the Alban kings to
                        the warlike and peaceful triumphs of the Augustan Age. The shield of
                        Achilles presents to the imagination the varied spectacle of human
                        life—sowing and reaping, a city besieged, a marriage festival, etc.; the
                        shield of Aeneas presents the spectacle of the most momentous crises in the
                        annals of Rome, culminating in the great triumph of Augustus. We note too in
                        the latter passage the enhancement of patriotic sentiment by the use of the
                        language and representation of Ennius, as at lines 630–634, and the lesson
                        taught of the dependence of national welfare on the observance of religious
                        traditions and of the duties of life sanctioned by religion, in the lines
                        which describe the processions of the Salii and Luperci, and which indicate
                        the punishment awarded to the sin of rebellion and disloyalty in the person
                        of Catiline, and the recognition of civic virtue, even when exercised in
                        defence of a losing cause, in the position assigned to Cato in the nether
                        world— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Iliad and the Odyssey are thus seen to be essentially epics of human
                        life; the Aeneid is essentially the epic of national glory. The Iliad indeed
                        is the noblest monument of the greatness, as it is of the genius, of the
                        Greeks. And the Aeneid is much more than a monument of national glory. It is
                        full of pathetic situations and stirring incidents which move our human
                        compassion or kindle our sympathies with heroic action. But if we ask what
                        are the most powerful sources of interest in the Greek and in the Roman epic
                        respectively, the answer will be that in the first these spring immediately
                        out of human life; in the second they spring out of the national fortunes.
                        And this distinction is generally recognisable in the art, literature, and
                        history of the two nations. This predominance of national interest and the
                        presence of a large element of living modern interest in the treatment of an
                        ancient legend separate the Aeneid still further from the Alexandrine epic
                        and its later Roman imitations. The compliance with the conditions of epic
                        poetry, as established by Homer and confirmed by the great law-giver of
                        Greek criticism, equally separates it from the rude attempts of Ennius and
                        Naevius, and from the poems which treat of historical subjects of a limited
                        and temporary significance, such as the Pharsalia of Lucan and the Henriade
                        of Voltaire. Though Virgil may be the most imitative, he is at the same time
                        one of the most original poets of antiquity. We saw that he had produced a
                        new type of didactic poetry. By the meaning and unity which he has imparted
                        to his Greek, Roman, and Italian materials through the vivifying and
                        harmonising agency of permanent national sentiment and of the immediate
                        feeling of the hour, he may be said to have created a new type of epic
                        poetry—to have produced a work of genius representative of his country as
                        well as a masterpiece of art. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Aeneid, like the Annals of Ennius, is a poem inspired by national
                        sentiment, and expressive of the idea of Rome. But the ‘Res Romana<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a>,’ the growth of which Ennius witnessed and celebrated, had become
                        greatly extended and had assumed a new form since the epic of the Republic
                        was written. Yet the sentiment of national glory was essentially the same in
                        the age of the elder Scipio and in the age of Augustus, though in the first
                        it may be described as still militant, in the second as triumphant. In each
                        time the Romans had a firm conviction of their superiority over all other
                        nations, and a firm trust in the great destiny which had attended them since
                        their origin, and still, as they believed, awaited them in the future. The
                        ground on which their national self-esteem rested was their capacity for
                        conquest and government; the result of that capacity was only fully visible
                        after the empire over the world was established. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The pride of empire is thus the most prominent mode in which the national
                        sentiment asserts itself in the poetry of the Augustan Age. In that series
                        of Odes in which the art of Horace becomes the organ of the new government
                        this sentiment finds expression by the mouth of the old enemy of the Roman
                        race, the goddess Juno:— </p>

                        imaginative associations, and describes acts of heroism with the glow of
                        martial enthusiasm, yet the crowning glory which he ascribes to the Romans
                        is the piety inherited from their Trojan ancestors. The final appeasement of
                        the rancour of Juno is secured by the declaration of Jupiter— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The national idea of Rome was associated also with the thought of the divine
                        origin, the great antiquity, the unbroken tradition, and the eternal
                        duration of the State. Universal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>empire,
                        uninterrupted continuity of existence, were the claims of the ancient
                        Imperial as of the modern Ecclesiastical Rome. And this idea, by the strong
                        hold which it had on the minds first of the Romans themselves and afterwards
                        of other nations, went far to realise itself. The confidence of the Romans
                        in themselves was intimately connected with their belief in their origin.
                        Ennius had impressed on their minds the belief in the miraculous birth of
                        their founder and in his miraculous elevation after death, and in the
                        protection afforded by the ‘augustum augurium’ by which the building of
                        their city had been consecrated. Among no people did ancient customs and
                        ceremonies, of which in many cases the origin was altogether forgotten,
                        survive with such vitality. In no other people did the memory of their past
                        history, whether of triumph or disaster, exercise so potent an influence on
                        the present time. In no Republic have the pride of birth and the reverence
                        felt to ancestors been so powerful and prevailing sentiments: no State has
                        ever been more loyal to the memory of the men who at successive crises in
                        its history had served it or saved it from its enemies: and no great secular
                        power ever felt so strong an assurance of an unbroken ascendency in the
                        future, and of the dependence of the fate of the world on that ascendency. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Aeneid appealed to all these sentiments even with more power than the
                        epic of the Republic and than the various national histories in which Roman
                        literature was peculiarly rich. Virgil, while still leaving to his
                        countrymen the pride of their descent from Mars, made them feel the charm of
                        their relation to a more gracious divinity, and even the hereditary claim
                        which they had to regard themselves as special objects of care to the
                        Supreme Ruler of Heaven<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a>. The
                        association of their destiny with the fortunes of Aeneas enabled them to
                        look back to a remoter and more famous epoch of antiquity than the legends
                        of their origin which had satisfied the fancy of the older Romans. Various
                        passages in the poem enable Virgil to invest impressive ceremonies, existing
                        in his own time, with the asso<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ciations of
                        an immemorial past. The three great prophetic passages in the first, sixth,
                        and eighth books enable him to revive, as Ennius had done, the thought of
                        the great men and families of Rome, and of the great events both of earlier
                        and more recent history. The march of Roman conquest during one hundred and
                        fifty momentous years enabled the younger poet to evoke greater, though in
                        some respects less happy, memories than those evoked by his predecessor. And
                        the security of the Empire established in his day justified him in looking
                        forward to the future with even a more assured confidence, though perhaps in
                        a less sanguine spirit. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The national sentiment manifesting itself in the pride of empire and deeply
                        rooted in the past, was combined with strong local attachments and the
                        attribution of a kind of sanctity to the great natural features of the land
                        or to spots associated with historic memories which had impressed themselves
                        on the hearts of successive generations. Virgil was, as we saw in examining
                        the Georgics, peculiarly susceptible of such impressions. There is no
                        passage in any ancient writer which makes us feel so vividly the ‘religio
                        loci’ which has for more than two thousand years invested the very site of
                        Rome as that in the eighth book of the Aeneid, in which Evander conducts
                        Aeneas over the ground destined to be occupied by the temples and dwellings
                        of Rome. The feeling which the sight of the Capitoline hill and of the
                        Tarpeian rock calls forth is one rather of religious awe than of any more
                        familiar sentiment. The feeling, on the other hand, with which the Tiber is
                        introduced— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> is one rather of proud affection than of religious veneration. The aspect of
                        the great city itself awed the imagination rather than called forth the
                        affections of her citizens. But these affections were given to the rivers
                        and streams, the lakes, and mountain-homes of Italy. Patriotism in the
                        Augustan Age was as much an Italian as a Roman sentiment. The military
                        greatness of Rome was even more identified with the discipline and cou<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rage of the Marsian and Apulian<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a> soldier than with that of the

                        with the virtues of the old Sabellian stock than with those of the ‘populus
                        Romanus Quiritium.’ While the Georgics celebrate the peaceful glory and
                        beauty of Italy, the Aeneid evokes the memory of its old warlike renown— </p>

                        the hardihood and warlike aptitude of the people, as the Georgics identify

                        antagonist. The thought of Rome as their head had become to the other
                        Italian tribes their basis of union with one another and the main ground of
                        their self-esteem in relation to other nations. To that self-esteem and
                        sense of superiority Virgil was fully alive. He is not altogether free from
                        the narrowness of national prejudice. He has not the largeness of soul which
                        enables Homer, while never losing his sense of the superiority of the Greeks
                        over the Trojans, yet to awaken feelings of admiration and of generous pity
                        for Hector and Sarpedon, for Priam and Andromache. Yet if Virgil has not
                        this largeness of soul he has the tenderness of human compassion:— </p>

                        gratified a sentiment still fresh in the minds of his countrymen, by
                        attributing to Dido the shameless licence as well as the dangerous
                        fascination of Cleopatra; or he might have painted the Carthaginians in
                        traditional colours of cruelty and treachery, in which Roman writers
                        represented the most formidable among the enemies of Rome. But Virgil’s
                        artistic sense or his humaner feeling saved him from this ungenerous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gratification of national prejudice. Yet
                        while more just or tolerant than other Roman writers to the Carthaginians,

                        like antipathy to the Greeks. The triumph of Rome over her Greek enemies is

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The bitterness of national animosity is especially apparent in his
                        exhibition of the characters of Ulysses and Helen. The superiority of the
                        Greeks in the arts and sciences is admitted not without some touch of scorn
                        (‘credo equidem’) in contrast with the superiority of Rome in the imperial
                        arts of conquering and governing nations. It may appear strange that the
                        only race to which Virgil is unjust or ungenerous is the one to which he
                        himself, in common with all educated Romans, was most deeply indebted. But
                        it is to be remembered that there was a dramatic propriety in the expression
                        of this hostility in the mouth of Aeneas and of Anchises. The championship
                        of the cause of Troy demanded an attitude of antagonism to her destroyer.
                        The Greek tragedians had themselves set the example of a degraded
                        representation of two of the most admirable of Homer’s creations; and
                        Virgil’s mode of conceiving and delineating character is much nearer to that
                        of Euripides than to that of Homer. The original error of Helen and the
                        craft in dealing with his enemies, which is one of many qualities in the
                        versatile humanity of Odysseus, gave to these later artists
                        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the germ, in accordance with which the whole
                        character was conceived. They did not adequately apprehend that the most
                        interesting types of nobleness and beauty of character as imagined by the
                        greatest artists are also the most complex, and the least capable of being
                        squared with abstract conceptions of vices or virtues. The full truth of
                        Homer’s delineations of character was apparently not recognised by the most
                        cultivated of his Roman readers. It is enough for Virgil that Ulysses is
                        ‘fandi fictor,’ as it is for Horace that Achilles is ‘iracundus,
                        inexorabilis, acer:’ although the worldly wisdom of the last-named poet
                        makes him comprehend better Homer’s ideal of intelligent than his ideal of
                        emotional heroism:— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Juvenal exhibits the virulence of national animosity towards the Greeks of
                        his time, as well as a well-founded scorn of the moral baseness of character
                        exhibited by many of them. The contempt of Tacitus is shown for their
                        intellectual frivolity, combined with their assumption of intellectual
                        superiority (‘qui sua tantum mirantur<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>’) based on the renown of their ancestors. The deference which
                        Virgil and Horace might pay to the genius of early Greece was not due to the
                        shadow of that genius as it existed in their own time. But the contemporary
                        Greek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">littérateurs</span></span> were not likely to resign their
                        claim of precedence in favour of their new rivals. Neither Greek art<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> nor Greek criticism seems ever to have made any cordial
                        recognition of the literary genius of Italy. The light in which Virgil
                        represents the Greek character may thus perhaps owe something to the wish to
                        repay scorn with scorn. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And it was Virgil’s aim in the Aeneid to show that this edifice of Roman
                        Empire, of which the enterprise of Aeneas was the foundation, on which the
                        old Kings of Alba and of Rome and the successive generations of great men
                        under the Republic had successively laboured, and on which Augustus placed
                        the coping-stone, was no mere work of human hands, but had been designed and
                        built up by divine purpose and guidance. The Aeneid expresses the religious
                        as it does the national sentiment of Rome. The two modes of sentiment were
                        inseparable. The belief of the Romans in themselves was another form of
                        their absolute faith in the invisible Power which protected them. This
                        invisible Power was sometimes recognised by them under the name of ‘Fortuna
                        Urbis,’—the spiritual counterpart of the city visible to their eyes. The
                        recognition of this divinity was not only compatible with, but involved the
                        recognition of, many other divinities associated with it in this protecting
                        office. But to these numerous divinities no very distinct personality was
                        attached. It was the awe of an ever-present invisible Power, manifesting
                        itself by arbitrary signs, exacting jealously certain definite observances,
                        capable of being alienated for a time by any deviation from these
                        observances, and of being again appeased by a right reading of and humble
                        compliance with its will, and working out its own purposes through the
                        agency of the Roman arms and the wisdom of Roman counsels, that was the
                        moving power of Roman religion. The Jove of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Capitol in early times, the living Emperor under the Empire,
                        were the visible representatives of this mysterious Power. But its influence
                        was acknowledged throughout all Roman history in the importance attached to
                        the great priestly offices, and especially to that of Pontifex Maximus,
                        which became inseparably united to the office of Emperor; in the scrupulous
                        regard paid to the auspices through which this Power was believed to
                        communicate its will; in the ominous interpretation put on all appearances
                        of departure from the ordinary course of Nature; and in the reference to the
                        Sibylline books in all questions of difficulty. This impersonal Power is to
                        the Romans both the object of awe and the source of their confidence. They
                        seem never to distrust the steadfastness of its favour. They rather feel
                        themselves its willing instruments, co-operating with it, blindly sometimes
                        and sometimes remissly, and for every failure of intelligence or vigilance,
                        punished by temporal calamities. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The word by which Virgil recognises the agency of this impersonal, or
                        perhaps we should rather say undefined, Power, is ‘Fatum,’ or more often in
                        the plural, ‘Fata.’ It is by the ‘Fates’ that the action is set in motion
                        and directed to its issue. The human and even the divine actors in the story
                        are instruments in their hands; some more, some less conscious of the part
                        they are performing. Even Jupiter is represented rather as cognisant of the
                        Fates than as their author. Sometimes indeed they are spoken of as ‘Fata
                        Iovis;’ and to the assurance given by him to Venus ‘manent immota tuorum
                        Fata tibi,’ he adds the words ‘neque me sententia vertit<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a>.’ But again, while his will is suspended in a

                        But there is no collision between them. While the prayers of men are

                        poem, and the constantly recurring and even monotonous expression of it. In
                        the first three books, for instance, the word ‘Fatum’ or ‘Fata’ occurs more
                        than forty times. Aeneas starts on his wanderings ‘fato profugus.’ Juno
                        desires to secure the empire of the world to Carthage ‘Si qua fata sinant.’

                        Trojan settlement in Italy, ‘Quippe vetor fatis.’ Aeneas comforts his

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Aeneas describes himself as starting from Troy ‘data fata secutus.’ A
                        hundred more instances might be given of the dominating influence of this
                        idea in the poem. It is the ‘common-place’ of the Virgilian epic. While it
                        adds impressiveness to the historical significance of the poem, it detracts
                        largely from the personal interest by the limits which it imposes on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>free agency of the divine and human actors
                        playing their part in it. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The same idea is often expressed by Tacitus, but it does not in him dominate
                        so absolutely over human will, nor is it asserted with the same firmness of
                        conviction. His conception of the regulating power over all human, or at
                        least over all national existence, seems to waver between this idea of some
                        unknown power steadily working out its purpose, of an element in human
                        affairs baffling all calculation—the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">παράλογος</span></span> of Thucydides and
                        the ‘Fortuna saevo laeta negotio’ of Horace—and of the gods generally as
                        personal avengers of crime, and sometimes as the kind protectors of the
                        State. Thus in the Germania<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a> the earliest
                        foreboding of the danger which threatened and ultimately overthrew the
                        fabric of the Empire is indicated in the words ‘urgentibus imperii fatis:’
                        in the Agricola the result of the invasion of Britain under Claudius is
                        summed up in the words ‘domitae gentes, capti reges, et monstratus fatis
                            Vespasianus<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a>:’
                        in the Histories the grounds of confidence on the part of the Vespasians in
                        taking arms against the Vitellians are summed up in the words ‘dux Mucianus
                        et Vespasiani nomen ac nihil arduum fatis<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a>.’ But
                        elsewhere he speaks of ‘ludibria rerum humanarum<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a>,’ in language reminding us of Lucretius, and, in almost the
                        very words of Horace, of ‘instabilis fortunae summaque et ima miscentis<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a>.’ Like
                        Horace, he seems to acknowledge the supremacy of chance or an ironical
                        spirit over individual fortunes, and, like Virgil, that of Fate over the
                        national destiny. But in the Annals, his latest work, he seems to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>incline more to the belief in the personal
                        agency of the gods, and especially in their agency as the avengers of guilt.
                        Thus he opens the passage of the deepest tragic gloom in all his sombre
                        record with the words, ‘Noctem sideribus illustrem quasi convincendum ad
                        scelus dii praebuere<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a>.’ So too he speaks of appealing to the ‘avenging gods<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>;’ and of the ‘fear of the wrath of
                            heaven<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a>.’ Occasionally indeed he
                        speaks of ‘the kindness of the gods<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>,’
                        but more often of their wrath or their indifference. Thus he attributes the
                        ascendency of Sejanus not to any superior ability on his own part, but to
                        ‘the wrath of the gods against the Roman commonwealth<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>;’ and, in recounting a number of omens which followed on
                        the murder of Agrippina, he makes the sarcastic comment, ‘quae adeo sine
                        cura deum eveniebant, ut multos post annos Nero imperium et scelera
                            continuaverit<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a>.’ In a writer like Tacitus it is impossible to distinguish with
                        certainty between the pure expression of his convictions and the rhetorical
                        and poetical colouring of his style. Yet both the frequency with which such
                        passages recur, and the earnestness of their tone even when they seem most
                        ironical, leave no doubt that, like Thucydides, he was not indifferent to
                        these questions, although ‘perplexed in the extreme’ by the apparent
                        absence, or at least uncertainty, of any steadfast moral order in the award
                        of happiness and calamity to men. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ‘Fatum’ or ‘Fata’ of Virgil can scarcely be said to act with the aim of
                        establishing right in the world, or of punishing wrong. Their action is
                        purely political, neither ethical, though its ultimate tendency is
                        beneficent, nor personal. Yet in the prominence which is given to this
                        determining element in national affairs Virgil is expressing the strongest
                        and most abiding belief of the Roman people, just as the Greek poets and
                        historians of the fifth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, in the
                        prominence they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>give to the element of
                        uncertainty in the world,—the irony in human affairs, or the Nemesis of the
                        gods excited against great prosperity even when not misused or gained by
                        crime,—expressed the dominant idea in the minds of their contemporaries.
                        Mr. Grote traces the origin of this last idea to the experience of the rapid
                        vicissitudes from one extreme of fortune to the other, brought about by the
                        great prosperity of the Greek states on the one hand and their incessant
                        wars and political feuds on the other. The origin of the other idea is to be
                        found in the almost unbroken success of Rome in all her enterprises, from
                        the burning of the city by the Gauls till the full establishment of empire.
                        There is no history in which chance plays so small a part, and in which so
                        little is episodical. The ‘good fortune of the Roman people’ will be found
                        to be explained either by the traditional policy of never making a new enemy
                        until they had well disposed of the old, or by the magnanimity (as compared
                        at least with the policy of other States<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href="#note_537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a>) by which they converted the nations successively conquered by
                        them into fellow-citizens or obedient allies, or by the indomitable
                        resolution which never knew to yield to defeat. No important event in their
                        history is isolated; each serves as a link in the chain which connects their
                        past with their future. The unvarying result of their national discipline
                        and policy, and of the force accumulated through centuries before they
                        became corrupted by the gains of conquest, might well appear to a race,
                        gifted with little speculative capacity, to be determined and accomplished
                        by an Omnipotent Power behind them. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This idea determines the general conduct of the action in the Aeneid. The
                        actors in the story either oppose the irresistible tendency of things and
                        suffer defeat or perish in their resistance; or, with gradually increasing
                        knowledge, they co-operate with and become the instruments of this tendency.
                        And as it is by faith in the divine assistance and guidance that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the latter are able to act their part
                        successfully, the religious motives of the representation assume a
                        prominence at least equal to that of its national and political motives.
                        Thus the object of all the hero’s wanderings is not only to found a city,
                        but to introduce a new worship into Italy—‘inferretque deos Latio.’ When
                        Hector appears to Aeneas in a vision he commits into his care the sacred
                        symbols and images of Troy with the words </p>

                        treaty with Latinus, while the secular and imperial power is left with the
                        Italians, the religious predominance is claimed for Aeneas,— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The influence of the religious idea of the poem is seen also in the leading
                        characteristic of the hero—‘insignem pietate virum.’ His piety appears in
                        the faith which he has in his mission, and in the trust which he has in
                        divine guidance. Prayer is his first resource in all emergencies; sacrifice
                        and thanksgiving are the accompaniments of all his escapes from danger and
                        difficulty. This characteristic deprives the representation of Aeneas of the
                        interest springing from energetic resource or spontaneous feeling. But as
                        much as the character loses in human interest, it gains in the impression
                        produced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a fitting instrument to carry
                        out the purpose of a Power working secretly for a distant end. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The effect of the same idea is apparent in the way in which the action is
                        furthered by special revelations, visions, prophecies, omens, and the like.
                        These intimations of the future are, for the most part, altogether of an
                        unpoetical and unimaginative character. The omens by which the Fates make
                        their will known, such as the omen of the cakes and of the white sow with
                        her litter, are, like those that occur so often in the pages of Livy, of an
                        essentially prosaic type: not like those in Homer, striking sights or sounds
                        acting on the imagination with the force of divine warning. Occasionally
                        Virgil’s own invention, or perhaps the guidance of some Greek predecessor,
                        suggests signs of a less trivial significance—such as that of the meteor or
                        line of light marking out the way from the burning city to Mount Ida— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> but for the most part the formal, superstitious, prosaic element in the
                        Roman religion—the same element which made their generals before some
                        decisive battle allow themselves to draw their auguries from the mode in
                        which chickens ate their food,—is present in the religious guidance of the
                        action. The Roman belief in the supernatural was arrested and stunted at a
                        primitive stage of religious development. So far from elevating the thought
                        and enlarging the imagination, that belief tended to repress all
                        speculation, lofty contemplation, and poetry. Even Virgil’s idealising art
                        fails to conceal the triviality of the media through which the invisible
                        Power made its will and purpose manifest. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The mythological machinery of the poem also, although borrowed from the
                        repertory of Homer, yet moves in obedience to this silent, impersonal,
                        uncapricious Power. Juno endea<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>vours to
                        strive against it, till forced to confess her impotence. Venus by her
                        intrigues serves to further its purposes. Yet both these Olympian divinities
                        are but puppets ‘in some unknown Power’s employ,’ which makes for its own
                        end alike through their furtherance and antagonism. The gods who take part
                        in the action are of Greek invention, but the Power which even they are
                        obliged to obey, if not Roman in original conception, is yet essentially
                        Roman in significance. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This thought of an unseen Power, working by means of omens and miracles on
                        the mind of the hero of the poem, with the distant aim of establishing
                        universal empire in the hands of a people, obedient to divine will and
                        observant of all religious ceremonies, may be said to be the theological or
                        speculative idea of the poem. It is the doctrine of predestination in its
                        hardest form. It is a thought much inferior both in intellectual subtlety
                        and in ethical value to that of the Fate of Greek tragedy in conflict with
                        human will. Yet there is a kind of material force and greatness in Virgil’s
                        conception, and a consistency not with ideal truth but with visible facts.
                        The ideal truth of Sophocles—the idea of final purification and
                        reconcilement of a noble human nature with the divine nature—is not
                        manifest in the world: it is only in harmony with the best hopes and
                        aspirations of men. Virgil’s idea was the shadow of the great fact apparent
                        in his age,—the vast, inevitable, omnipotent, unsympathetic power of the
                        Roman empire. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there is another personal and humane religious element, not so prominent
                        and not so influential on the action, but pervading the poem like an
                        atmosphere, purifying it, and making it luminous with the light of a higher
                        region. This is the element of religious faith or hope, personal to Virgil
                        and yet catholic in its significance, and in harmony with the convictions of
                        religious men of all times. The rigid, formal, and narrow conceptions of the
                        Roman religion came into collision both with the belief in gods of like
                        passions with men, revealed in the art and poetry of the Greeks, and with
                        the development <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of ethical feeling and
                        especially of the sentiment of humanity fostered by Greek philosophy.
                        Virgil’s temperament, patriotic, imaginative, and humane, was in accord with
                        all these modes of religious conception. If national destiny and some
                        portions of the destiny of individuals are shaped by an inflexible power— </p>

                        attributes, but infinitely greater in power and knowledge, exists in the
                        Aeneid side by side with the doctrine of the omnipotence of Fate, crushing,
                        if necessary, human wishes and human happiness under its iron
                        determinations. But in the final award of happiness or misery after death,
                        revealed in the sixth book, the agency of Fate gives place to that of a
                        moral dispensation awarding to men their portions according to their
                        actions. The way in which Virgil indicates his belief in the spiritual life
                        after death is analogous to, as well as suggested by, the myths in the
                        Gorgias and in the tenth book of the Republic of Plato. While there is a
                        certain vagueness and uncertainty in his view of the condition in which the
                        souls of ordinary men pass the thousand years of purification before
                        drinking of the waters of Lethe and entering again on a mortal life, the
                        class of sinners to whom eternal punishment is awarded, and that of holy men
                        who dwell for ever in Elysium, are indicated with great definiteness and
                        beauty. In the first class are those whom the old Roman world regarded as

                        find their fullest realisation in the position assigned to Augustus. The
                        pride of empire, the loyalty to the State, the religious trust, which in the
                        age of Ennius attached themselves to the ‘Respublica Romana,’ found, in the
                        age of Virgil, a new centre of attraction in the person of the Emperor. A
                        poem, which should express the dominant idea and sentiment of that age,
                        could not fail to bring into prominence the change through which the
                        government not of Rome only but of the whole civilised world was then
                        passing. The relations of the great poets of the time to the men at the head
                        of affairs made them the fittest exponents of this new tendency. They used
                        their art with the view of giving to public sentiment a permanent direction
                        in favour of the new order of things. The political object of glorifying the
                        personal rule of Augustus and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
                        surrounding it with the halo of a divine sanction associated itself with the
                        artistic, the patriotic, and the religious objects of Virgil. And although
                        the excess of eulogy and some modes of its manifestation offend the modern,
                        as they would have offended a more ancient sentiment of personal dignity,
                        there is no reason to question the disinterested sincerity of Virgil’s
                        panegyric. The permanence of the change introduced by Augustus attests the
                        fact that his policy not only kindled the enthusiasm of the moment, but met
                        the most deeply-felt needs of the world. And though his personal qualities
                        and the great things accomplished by him do not touch the imagination or
                        awaken the sentiment of admiration in modern times, like those of his
                        immediate predecessor in power, yet he was pre-eminently the man suited to
                        his age, as an age of restoration and re-organisation, and he was
                        pre-eminently a Roman of the Romans. The great C. Julius, in his genius and
                        qualities, ‘towers’ not only above his own nation but, ‘like Hannibal, above
                        all nations.’ The perfect success of Augustus was due to the fact not only
                        that he was the man wanted by his epoch, but that he was the complete
                        embodiment of the great practical talents and character of Rome. He not only
                        monopolised in his own person all the chief functions, but in his
                        administration he displayed all the best and most varied capacities of the
                        Roman magistracy. In his government and in his legislation he exercised the
                        influence formerly exercised by Censor and Chief of the Senate, by Consul
                        and Proconsul, by Praetor and Aedile. To the aptitudes for these various
                        duties he added those that fitted him at least to fill the place of
                        ‘Imperator’ at the head of the Roman armies, and to give new importance and
                        efficacy to the office of Pontifex Maximus. He possessed also in a
                        remarkable degree the personal qualities of industry, vigilance, practical
                        sagacity, authority, dignity, and urbanity, which are of most importance in
                        the government of men. If his character falls below both the ancient and the
                        modern ideal of heroism, it is thoroughly conformable to a Roman ideal of
                        practical power and usefulness. He is the representative man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the brighter side of Roman imperialism, as
                        Tiberius (till his final retirement from Rome),—in his strength of body and
                        mind, his military and administrative capacity, his unrelieved application
                        to business<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a>, his
                        unsympathetic impartiality, his suspicious and ruthless policy in
                        suppressing opposition, his callous indifference to suffering,—is of its
                        more sombre side. It is a great enhancement of the representative character
                        of Virgil’s national epic, that it is associated with the name and acts of
                        one who was not only the founder, but was the most typical embodiment of the
                        Roman empire. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Although the choice of the subject of the Aeneid was determined, in a great
                        measure, by its adaptability to the personal and political object of Virgil,
                        no attempt is made to exhibit either the character or the actions of Aeneas
                        as symbolical of those of Augustus. Still less are we to look for any modern
                        parallels to the other personages of the poem, such as Turnus or Dido,
                        Latinus or Lavinia, Drances or Achates. Yet the position assigned to Aeneas,
                        as a fatherly ruler over his people, their chief in battle, their law-giver
                        in peace, and their high-priest in all spiritual relations, may have been
                        intended as a kind of symbol of the new monarchy. The Roman imagination
                        acknowledged two ideals of a ruler of men,—the ideal of a Romulus and that
                        of a Numa. In Aeneas both are combined with the characteristics of a new
                        ideal which rather anticipated a future, than reproduced any older type of
                        character. Augustus too might be regarded as at once the Romulus and the
                        Numa of the new empire; and thus the parts played by Aeneas, as chief in
                        battle and legislator in peace<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a>, might be regarded as a kind of foreshadowing of those
                        which were afterwards played by Augustus on the real stage of human <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>affairs. But it would be no compliment
                        either to the intellectual power of Augustus or to the discernment of
                        Virgil, to suppose that the personal attributes of Aeneas were intended to
                        have any resemblance to the strong and self-reliant character of the
                        Emperor. The relation to Aeneas adds to the personal glory of Augustus by
                        the ancestral distinction thus conferred upon him,—a distinction at all
                        times highly prized among the Romans, and especially prized by the Caesars
                        as helping to reconcile a proud aristocracy to their ascendency. In the
                        immediate successors of Augustus, the obscurity of the Octavii and Atii was
                        forgotten in the combined lustre of the Julian and Claudian families. And on
                        one of those occasions, in which the sentiment of family pride was most
                        powerfully appealed to,—the funeral of Drusus, son of Tiberius,—we read in
                        Tacitus—‘funus imaginum pompa maxime inlustre fuit, cum origo Iuliae gentis
                        Aeneas omnesque Albanorum reges, et conditor urbis Romulus, post Sabina
                        nobilitas, Attus Clausus, ceteraeque Claudiorum effigies, longo ordine
                            spectarentur<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a>.’ In thus throwing the halo both of a remote antiquity and of a
                        divine ancestry around Augustus, Virgil helped to recommend his rule to the
                        sentiment of his countrymen. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In seeking to enhance the greatness of a living ruler by associating him
                        with the actions of a remote legendary ancestor, the panegyric of Virgil
                        does not transcend the limits which Pindar allows himself in evoking the
                        mythical glories of the past in honour of his patrons. But Virgil seeks to
                        establish a closer connexion between the past and the present, than that
                        established by Pindar. The connexion between the living man, who wins a
                        victory in the games, and his heroic ancestor, is adduced as a proof of the
                        inheritance by the descendant of the personal qualities which first gave
                        distinction to his race. But the connexion between Aeneas and Augustus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is the connexion between means and end. The
                        actions of Aeneas are not held up as a mere example which his descendant
                        might emulate: they are the first links in the long chain of events which
                        reached from the siege of Troy to the victory of Actium and the
                        establishment of the empire. The distant vision of the glory awaiting the
                        greatest of his descendants is, more than any immediate or personal end, the
                        motive which animates both the divine and human actors in the enterprise. It
                        is after a vivid picture of the martial and peaceful glories of the Augustan
                        reign that the stirring appeal is made— </p>

                        military glory, of beneficent action on the world, of a divine sanction, and
                        of an ultimate heritage of divine honours. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Aeneid considered as a representative work of genius is thus seen to be
                        the expression or embodiment of an idea of powerful meaning for the age in
                        which the poem was written, for the centuries immediately succeeding that
                        age, and, through the action of historical associations, for all times. As
                        the great poem of Dante gained both immediate and permanent attention by the
                        human interest which it imparted to the spiritual idea on which mediaeval
                        Europe based its life; as the inspiration of Milton’s great Epic was drawn
                        from his passionate sympathy with the intensest form of religious and
                        political life in his age; so the quality of Virgil’s genius which secured
                        for him the most immediate and the most lasting consideration was his
                        sympathetic comprehension of the imperial idea of Rome in its secular,
                        religious, and personal significance. This idea he has ennobled with the
                        associations of a divine origin and of a divine sanction; of a remote
                        antiquity and an unbroken con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tinuity of
                        great deeds and great men; of the pomp and pride of war, and of the majesty
                        of government: and he has softened and humanised the impression thus
                        produced by the thought of peace, law, and order given to the world. In his
                        stately diction we are reminded only of the power, glory, majesty, and
                        civilising influence with which the idea of Rome is encompassed. There is
                        nothing to obtrude the thought of the spirit, in which life, freedom, and
                        individuality were crushed out of the world. And this idea, of which
                        Virgil’s poem is the glorified representation, was one actually realised,
                        one which influenced the lives of generations of men, and which was an
                        important element in moulding the whole subsequent history of the world. Yet
                        the idea is one more adapted to be the inspiring influence of a great
                        historical work, like the national history of Livy, or ‘The Decline and Fall
                        of the Roman Empire,’ than of a great poem, which must satisfy the human and
                        moral sympathies of men as well as their sense of power. Material greatness
                        and civilisation, and the qualities of mind and character through which
                        these effects are produced, exercise a great spell over the imagination and
                        the masculine sympathies of the world. But the highest art does more than
                        this—it enlarges man’s sense of a spiritual life, it purifies his notions
                        of happiness, it deepens his conviction of a righteous government of the
                        world. Through the imagination it speaks to the soul. The idea of imperial
                        Rome is rather that of the enemy than of the promoter of the spiritual life
                        or of individual happiness: it impresses on the mind the thought of a vast
                        and orderly, but not of a moral and humane government. The idea of the Roman

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> is suggestive of a nobler energy of character, of more abundant public and
                        private virtue, than the idea pervading and animating <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the polished verse of the Aeneid. The thought of the Rome of
                        Ennius is associated in our minds with the free political life of the Forum
                        and the Campus Martius, and with the grave deliberations of the Senate, as
                        well as with the exercise of military force and administrative sovereignty.
                        The idea of Italy pervading the Georgics has everything to attract and
                        nothing to repel our sympathies: and thus notwithstanding the inferior
                        opportunities for awakening human interest which necessarily attach to a
                        didactic when compared with an epic poem, the charm exercised by that poem
                        is more unmixed and unchanging than that of the poem which evokes the proud
                        memories of the Capitol. In the Aeneid, Virgil is really the panegyrist of
                        despotism under the delusive disguise of paternal government. In so far as
                        there is any conflict between right and wrong in the Aeneid, the wrong
                        appears to be the ‘victrix causa’ ‘which pleases the gods.’ The religious
                        idea of the Fates is invested with none of the ethical mystery with which
                        the analogous idea in Greek poetry is invested. They act in a hard, plain,
                        arbitrary way, irrespective of right and wrong, regardless of personal
                        happiness or suffering. The actors in the poem who move our sympathies are
                        those who perish in blind resistance to, or blind compliance with, their
                        decrees—Dido, Pallas, Turnus, and Lausus. The opposition between natural
                        human feeling and the ‘divom inclementia’ is reverently accepted and
                        acquiesced in by Virgil in the person of his hero. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The conclusion at which we arrive as to the value of the Aeneid as an epic
                        poem representative of the Roman Empire, is that Virgil has given a true,
                        adequate, and noble expression to an idea which actually has exercised a
                        greater spell over the imagination and a greater influence over the daily
                        lives of men, than any other which owed its origin to their secular
                        interests: but that this idea, regarded from its political, religious, and
                        personal side, is one which does not touch the heart, or enlighten the
                        conscience: and this is an important drawback to the claim which the Aeneid
                        may have to the highest rank as a work of art. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The national, religious, and political ideas which form the central interest
                        of the poem have been considered in the previous chapter. We have seen how
                        Virgil was moved by an impulse similar to that which acted on Ennius in a
                        ruder age, and in what way he strove to express the meaning which the idea
                        of Rome has for all times, and to find an adequate symbol of the dominant
                        sentiment of his own time. It remains to consider how far the poem sustains
                        by its command over our sympathies the interest thus established in its
                        favour; and to ascertain what value the Aeneid, as a poem of action,
                        unfolding a spectacle of human life, manners, character, and passion,
                        possessed for the Romans and still possesses for ourselves. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The action of the poem, apart from its bearing on the destinies of the
                        world, has a grandeur and dignity of its own. It is enacted on a great
                        theatre, developes itself by incidents giving free play to the highest modes
                        of human energy and passion, and through the agency of personages already
                        renowned in legend and poetry. In that mythical age which the poet recalls
                        to life no spectacle could be imagined more deserving to fix the attention
                        of the world than the fall of Troy, the building of Carthage, and the first
                        rude settlement on the hills of Rome. Whatever else may be said of the
                        personages of the story, they are conceived of as playing no common part in
                        human affairs. In following their fortunes we breathe the air of that high
                        poetic region which forms the undetermined border-land between mythology and
                        history. We look back on the ruined state of the greatest city of legendary
                        times, and we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mark the first beginnings of
                        the two Imperial cities which in historical times disputed the empire of the
                        world. The poem evokes the associations, ancient and recent, attaching to
                        the various scenes through which the action passes,—Troy, Carthage, Sicily,
                        the shores of Latium, the Tiber, and the hills on which Rome was built. The
                        vagueness of the time in which the action is laid enables the poet to
                        connect together, in a most critical position of human affairs, the fortunes
                        of the chief powers of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The spheres of man’s
                        activity in which the action moves—war and sea-adventure in search of
                        undiscovered lands—give the fullest scope to energetic representation. In
                        his conception of the voyage of Aeneas and of a great war determining the
                        issue of his enterprise, Virgil followed the greatest epic examples, and
                        found a subject to which he could impart the interest of adventurous
                        incident and heroic achievement. In his conception of the part played in the
                        action by the passion of love, he introduced a more familiar and modern
                        phase of life which the examples of the Greek tragedians and of the
                        Alexandrine epic had proved to be capable of idealising treatment. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The actors moreover who play their part in these critical events are not
                        ‘common or mean.’ The crisis is conceived of as one so momentous, from the
                        issues involved in it, as to call forth the passions and the energies of the
                        old Olympian Powers. But even the human personages of the story appear with
                        a prestige of glory and sanctity, and yet are sufficiently unfamiliar to
                        excite new expectations. Aeneas, as the son of a mightier goddess<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a>, is distinguished in the Iliad by the
                        honours of a higher lineage than Achilles. He is brave in war, the comrade
                        of Hector, a hero deemed worthy to encounter Achilles himself as well as
                        Diomede in battle. He is especially dear to the gods, and is marked out by
                        prophecy as destined to bear, and transmit to his descendants, the rule over
                        the remnant of the Trojans. To Anchises attaches the sanctity of one
                        enjoying a closer communion with the immortals, of one at once <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>favoured and afflicted above others, and elevated,
                        like Oedipus, out of weakness and suffering here, into honour and influence
                        beyond the grave. Iulus receives a reflected glory from the transcendent
                        greatness of the Julian house. Dido or Elissa was a name famous in
                        Phoenician legend, and associated with the ancient renown of Tyre. Evander
                        is illustrious from his Arcadian origin, from his relation to Hercules, from
                        the fame of his mother as one of the Italian Camenae. Even the mere ethnical
                        names of Latinus and Turnus receive individuality by being introduced in the
                        line of old Italian dynasties, and in direct connexion with Faunus, Picus,
                        and other beings of the native mythology. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It may therefore be said that in the choice of the time and the scenes in
                        which his action is laid, in the character of the action itself, and in the
                        eminence of the personages taking part in it, Virgil fulfils all the
                        conditions of his art which reflexion on the models of the past and on the
                        circumstances in life most capable of interesting the imagination could
                        teach him. The care with which he prepared himself for his task is as
                        remarkable as the judgment with which he conceived its main conditions. The
                        conduct of his story shows the most intimate familiarity with the incidents
                        and adventures contained in the Iliad and Odyssey, in the Cyclic poems and
                        the dramas founded on them, in the Homeric hymns and the Alexandrine epic.
                        It shows how Virgil so combines and varies the details thus suggested, as to
                        recall many features of the Homeric age, and at the same time to produce the
                        impression of something new in literary art. The revived image of that age
                        must have affected the contemporaries of the poet in a manner different from
                        its effect on us. To us both the Iliad and the Aeneid are ancient and
                        unfamiliar: the one comes before us as an original picture of manners, the
                        other as a copy taken in a long subsequent age. But to a Roman of the time
                        of Augustus the life of the Homeric age must have appeared almost as remote
                        as it does to us. The direct imitations of Homer in the Aeneid might produce
                        on his mind the same mixed impression of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>novelty and familiarity which is produced on a modern reader by the
                        reproduction and recasting of the doctrines, incidents, and language of the
                        Bible in the two epic poems of Milton. The fascination of this world of
                        supernatural agency and personal adventure, brought home to him for the
                        first time in the most elevated tones of his own language, may have charmed
                        the Roman reader in the same way as the revival of mediaeval romance in the
                        literary languages of modern Europe charmed the readers of the latter part
                        of the eighteenth and the first part of the nineteenth centuries. And if
                        such were the first impressions produced by the poem, a closer examination
                        of it must have shown that the imagination of Virgil had out of ancient
                        materials built up something new in the world. If his representation of the
                        heroic age wants the vivid truth and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">naïveté</span></span> of
                        Homer’s representation, yet it is impressive with the dignity of antique
                        associations, and rich with the colouring of his own human sensibilities. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the Aeneid not only revives the romance of the Greek heroic age: it
                        creates the romance of ‘that Italy for which Camilla the virgin, Euryalus,
                        and Turnus and Nisus died of wounds.’ It bestows the colour and warmth of
                        human life on dim traditions, on vague names, on the memories of early
                        warfare clinging to ancient towns, and on the origins of immemorial customs
                        and ceremonies. The task of giving poetic life to the dry prose of Cato, to
                        the dust of antiquarian learning, and to the rigid formalism of the old
                        Roman ceremonial must have taxed the poet’s powers more than that of
                        reawakening the interest in the old Homeric life. Virgil accomplishes this
                        result through his power of living at the same time in the past and in the
                        present; of feeling powerfully the associations of a remote antiquity, and
                        the immediate action of all that was most impressive to thought and
                        imagination in the age in which he lived. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The earlier works of Virgil had proved his strength in descriptive and
                        didactic poetry, and in the expression of personal feeling, of national
                        sentiment, and of ethical contemplation; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but they had given no indication of epic, and little of dramatic genius.
                        Although the episode of the ‘Pastor Aristaeus’ is a specimen of succinct,
                        animated, and pathetic narrative, it must be remembered that this was a late
                        addition to the Georgics, and was probably written after considerable way
                        had been made in the composition of the Aeneid. An epic poet, over and above
                        his purely poetic susceptibility, must possess the art and faculty of a
                        prose historian. Homer has in an unequalled degree the clearness, vividness,
                        and movement in telling his story, which characterise such writers as
                        Herodotus. The account given of Virgil’s mode of composition proves that he
                        took great pains both with the plan and the execution of his narrative. He
                        is said to have arranged the first draught of his story in prose, and then
                        to have worked on the various parts of it as they interested him at the time
                        of composition. There are clear indications that the books were not written
                        in the order in which they stand; and a few inconsistencies of statement
                        between the earlier and later books were left uncorrected at the time of the
                        author’s death. The poem, in the careful arrangement of its materials, bears
                        the stamp of the manner in which it was composed. Like that of every other
                        great Roman, the genius of Virgil was thoroughly orderly and systematic. But
                        along with the power of order Virgil had what many Roman writers want, the
                        power of variety. The narrative of the Aeneid is full of movement, succinct
                        or ample according to the prominence intended to be given to its different
                        parts. The various streams of action are kept separate, yet not too far
                        apart to cause any confusion or forgetfulness when the time comes to unite
                        them. There is at once weight and energy in the movement of the main
                        current: it neither hurries nor flags, but advances for the most part
                        steadily, ‘quadam intentione gravitatis.’ If it wants the buoyancy and
                        vivacity of the narrative of Herodotus, it shows the concentrated energy
                        which distinguishes the works of the great Roman historians. It brings
                        before us rather a series of grave events, bearing on a great issue and
                        following an inevitable course, than the vicissitudes of individual fortunes
                            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and the play of human passions and
                        impulses: and in this it is in accordance both with the actual history of
                        Rome, and with the record of it contained in literature. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Virgil cannot be said to have failed either in the conception of his
                        subject, in the collection and preparation of his materials, or in the art
                        and faculty demanded for impressive narrative. Yet all feel that the Aeneid
                        is much inferior to the Homeric poems in natural human interest, as it is
                        much inferior in reflective interest to the greatest extant dramas of
                        Aeschylus and Sophocles. The poem, as a whole, produces the impression
                        rather of careful construction than of organic growth. The reflexion
                        employed on it is rather that of a critic applying artistic principles to
                        impart unity to many heterogeneous materials, than that of an imaginative
                        thinker, seeing his story unfold itself before him in the light of some
                        great intuition into the secret meanings of life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His inferiority to Homer in the power of making his story at once vividly
                        real and nobly ideal arises partly from an inferiority in his own temper,
                        and partly from the inferior adaptability of the life of his own age to
                        imaginative treatment. There is no trace in Virgil of that keen enjoyment of
                        personal adventure and bodily activity which is present in every page of the
                        Homeric poems. Virgil’s materials are gathered from study and reflexion, not
                        from strong and many-sided contact with life. Though he writes of ‘arma
                        virumque’ with a Roman sense of the duty of disregarding danger and death,
                        he has none of the ‘delight of battle’ which animates the Iliad and the
                        poetical and prose romances of Scott. Neither does he make us feel that
                        elevation of spirit in the presence of the danger of the sea, which the
                        author of the Odyssey among ancient, and Byron among modern poets,
                        communicate to their readers. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the vast difference in manners, feelings, and modes of thought, between
                        an early and a late age—between the spring and the autumn of ancient
                        civilisation—presented still more insuperable obstacles to Virgil in his
                        attempt to accomplish the work of Homer. In the first period imagination is
                        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ruling faculty of life, the great
                        impeller to action and discovery, the chief prompter both of hope and fear:
                        and thus the movement and impulses of such an age readily yield themselves
                        to imaginative treatment. Poets and dramatists of a later time who desire to
                        represent life in its most energetic phase endeavour to reproduce some image
                        of this early time by a constructive act of imagination. A dramatist may
                        take the mere outline of some ancient legend and fill it with modern thought
                        and sentiment. He is not called on for that realistic reproduction of
                        manners and usages which an epic poet is expected to exhibit on his larger
                        canvas. The difficulty which the latter has to meet is that of verifying by
                        anything in his own experience the impression which he forms from the study
                        of ancient art and records. Homer alone, by living the imaginative life of
                        an earlier time, was able to represent that life in its truth, its fulness
                        of being, its vivid sense of pleasure and pain. The age mirrored in the
                        Homeric poems is the true age of romance and personal enterprise, when the
                        individual acquires ascendency through his own qualities of strength,
                        beauty, courage, force of mind, natural eloquence; when the world is
                        regarded as the scene of supernatural agencies manifesting themselves in
                        visible shape; when men live more in the open air than in houses and cities,
                        and have to procure subsistence, comfort, and security by energy of body and
                        the inventive resources of their minds; and when their hearts are alive to
                        every natural emotion, not deadened by routine or enervated by excess of
                        pleasure. Hence it is that all Homer’s accounts of war and battles, of
                        sea-adventure, of debates in the council of chiefs or in the assemblies of
                        the people, of games and contests of strength, are so full of living
                        interest. Hence too comes the vivacity with which all the details of
                        procuring food, the enjoyment of eating and drinking and sinking to sleep,
                        the arming or clothing of heroes, the management of a ship at sea, the
                        ordinary occupations of the hunter or the herdsman are described. To the
                        same cause is due the truth and appropriateness of all the descriptions from
                        Nature,—of the dawn and sunrise, of storms, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the gathering of clouds, of the constellations, of the stillness of
                        night, of the habits of wild animals, of the more violent forces of the
                        elements, of the omens which suddenly appear to men engaged in battle or
                        assembled in council in the open air and awaiting a sign for their guidance. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> An image of this Homeric life Virgil has to reproduce from the midst of a
                        state of society utterly unlike it. The Augustan Age was pre-eminently an
                        age of order and material civilisation, in which great results were
                        produced, not by individual force, but by masses and combinations of men
                        directed by political sagacity and secret council; in which the life of the
                        richer class was passed in great cities and luxurious villas; in which the
                        comforts of life were abundantly supplied through the organisation of
                        commerce and the ministrations of a multitude of slaves<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a>; in which the outward world was enjoyed as a beautiful
                        spectacle rather than as a field of active exertion and personal adventure;
                        in which the belief in the supernatural was fixed in imposing outward
                        symbols, but was no longer a fresh source of wonder and expectation; an age
                        too, in which the natural emotions of the heart and imagination were
                        becoming deadened by satiety and the ‘strenua inertia’ of luxurious living. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The art of Virgil is thus powerless to produce a true image of the life and
                        manners of the Homeric age. Yet he does surround the actors in his story
                        with an environment of religious belief and observances, of political and
                        social life, of material civilisation, of martial movement and
                        sea-adventure, formed partly out of his poetical and antiquarian studies,
                        partly out of the familiar spectacle of his own age, partly out of his
                        personal sympathies and convictions. And this representation, though <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it necessarily wants the vital freshness
                        and vigour of Homer’s representation, has a peculiar dignity and charm of
                        its own. It must be accepted as an artistic compromise, and not as the
                        idealised picture of any life that has ever been realised in the world. It
                        is one of the earliest and most interesting products of that kind of
                        imagination which has in modern times created the literature of romance<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a>. The work in English poetry which comes most near to the
                        Aeneid in the union of modern ethical and political feeling with the
                        spectacle of the martial life and the ideas of the supernatural belonging to
                        a much earlier time, is ‘The Faery Queen<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a>:’ though the allegorical meaning of that poem is as different
                        as possible from the solid basis of fact—the marvellous career of Rome—on
                        which the Aeneid is founded. Virgil produces much more than Spenser the
                        illusion of a kind of life not absolutely withdrawn from mundane experience.
                        The scenes through which he guides the personages of his story are the
                        familiar places of central Italy, of Sicily, of the Greek islands, of the
                        shores of Africa. These personages are engaged in important transactions,
                        such as make up the actual history of early nations,—wars, alliances,
                        intermarriages, and the like. Even the supernatural element in the poem
                        produces the illusion, if not of conformity with the belief of men in the
                        age in which the poem was written, yet of conformity with that stage in the
                        whole growth and decomposition of ancient beliefs which, through the works
                        of art and poetry, has made the deepest impression on the world. Thus if
                        Virgil’s representation of scenes, persons, incidents, modes of life,
                        supernatural belief, etc. wants both the freshness and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">naïveté</span></span> of Homer and the ideality and exuberance of fancy
                        characteristic of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Spenser, it is yet a
                        solid creation of the classical mind, exercised for the first time on a
                        great scale in bodying forth an imaginary foretime, peopling it with the
                        personages of earlier art or of the poet’s fancy, and filling up the
                        outlines of tradition with the sentiment, the interests, and the ideas of
                        the age in which the poem was written. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In addition to his great knowledge of antiquity and his gift of living in
                        the creations of earlier art and poetry, Virgil possessed in his own
                        imaginative constitution elements of power which enabled him to give
                        solidity and beauty to the world of his invention. Among these elements of
                        power his feeling of religious awe, his sense of majesty investing the forms
                        of government, his veneration for antiquity, his susceptibility to the
                        associations attaching to particular places, are conspicuous. His sympathy
                        with the primary human affections suggests to him the details of many
                        pathetic situations. He has a Roman admiration for courage, endurance, and
                        magnanimous bearing. His refined perceptions, perfected by a life of
                        studious culture and by familiarity with the social life of men inheriting
                        the traditions of a great governing class, enable him to make the various
                        actors on his stage play their parts with grace and dignity. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By some of these sources of imaginative power Ennius also was moved in the
                        composition of his epic. In that which is Virgil’s strength, sympathy with
                        the primary human affections, it would have been impossible for any poet who
                        came after them to have surpassed Homer, Sophocles, or Lucretius. But in
                        Homer this sympathy is combined with a sterner, in Sophocles with a severer
                        mood. In Lucretius the feeling is identified with the general melancholy of
                        his thought. The feeling of humanity in Virgil is as original and pervading
                        as the feeling with which Nature affects him. From all these elements of
                        inspiration, his imagination is able to body forth the world of his creation
                        in the remote border-land of history and mythology, and to impart to it not
                        only solidity and self-consistency, but also grandeur of outline and beauty
                        of detail. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The first general impression produced by reading the Aeneid immediately
                        after reading the Iliad, is that the supernatural ‘machinery,’ consisting in
                        a great degree of the agency of the Olympian gods in hindering or furthering
                        the catastrophe, is the most imitative and conventional element in the poem.
                        But a closer examination of its whole texture brings to light beneath the
                        more conspicuous figures of the Homeric mythology, the presence of other
                        modes of religious belief, feeling, and practice. And even the parts
                        assigned to the greater deities have been recast for the purposes of
                        Virgil’s epic. If these deities have lost much in vivacity and energy, they
                        have gained in dignity of demeanour. The two most active amongst them are
                        indeed as little scrupulous in the means they employ to attain their ends,
                        as they show themselves in the Iliad. They are as regardless of individual
                        happiness as they appear in some of the dramas of Euripides. And we cannot
                        attribute to Virgil, what has been attributed to Euripides, the intention of
                        bringing the objects of popular belief into disrepute<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a>. He seems to feel that they are above man’s
                        questioning; that it is for him ‘parere quietum;’ and that it is well with
                        him if through long suffering he at last obtains reconciliation with them.
                        But the Venus and Juno of the Aeneid are at least exempt from some of the
                        lower appetites and more ferocious passions with which they are animated in
                        the Iliad. They have learned the tact and dissimulation of the life of an
                        Imperial society. They are actuated by political rather than by personal
                        passions. They move with a certain Roman state and dignity of bearing— </p>

                        pages of Tacitus. The ‘mother of the Aeneadae’ combines a subtlety of device
                        and persistence of purpose with the charm which befits the ancestress of a
                        family in which personal beauty, as is attested by many extant statues, was
                        as conspicuous as force of intellect and of character. The Jove of the
                        Aeneid, though he appears without the outward signs of majesty which
                        inspired the conception of the Pheidian Zeus, and though the part he plays
                        in controlling the action appears somewhat tame, yet sometimes gives
                        utterance to thoughts which recall the grave and steadfast attributes which
                        the Romans reverenced under the title of ‘Iuppiter Stator,’— </p>

                        contributes some of the few beings endowed with human personality which it
                        produced. The creation of Egeria, of the Nymph Marica, and of the goddess
                        Juturna was due to the same sentiment, associated with lakes, rivers, and
                        brooks, which gave birth to the Naiads and River-gods of Greek mythology. Of
                        these Juturna alone, as the sister of the Italian hero of the poem, bears

                        that doubtful title to distinction which made the innumerable heroines of

                        Janus, and Picus appear as a line of kings, who lived and reigned in Latium

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ordinary modes in which the divine personages of Virgil’s story take
                        part in the action are suggested by incidents in the Homeric poems or Hymns,
                        and, apparently in some instances, by the parts assigned to them in the
                        dramas of Euripides. Thus the office performed by Venus in telling the story
                        of Dido previous to the landing of Aeneas on the shores of Africa, and by
                        Diana in telling the romantic incidents of Camilla’s childhood, may have
                        been suggested by the prologues to the Hippolytus, the Bacchae, and the
                        Alcestis. But other manifestations of supernatural agency, and those not the
                        least impressive, are due to Virgil’s own invention, and are inspired by
                        that sense of awe with which the thought of the invisible world affects his
                        imagination. Juvenal, when contrasting the comfort which enabled Virgil to
                        do justice to his genius with the poverty of the poets of his own time,
                        selects as an instance of his imaginative power the passage in the Seventh
                        Book of the Aeneid which describes the terror inspired by Allecto. And
                        certainly the whole description of the appearance of the Fury on earth, from
                        the time when she enters the palace of Latinus till she disappears among the
                        woods which add to the gloom of the black torrent of Amsanctus, is full of
                        energy. So too is the brief description of Juno completing the work of her
                        agent—one of many passages of which the solemn effect is enhanced by the
                        use of the language of Ennius— </p>

                        more primitive and more widely spread than the worship of the Olympian gods,
                        or of the impersonal abstractions of Italian theology. The religious fancies
                        which originally united each city, each tribe, and each family into one
                            community<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a>,
                        had been transmitted in popular beliefs and in ceremonial observances from a
                        time long antecedent to the establishment of the Olympian dynasty of gods.
                        This brighter creation of the imagination did not banish the secret awe
                        inspired by the older spiritual conceptions. Invisible Powers were supposed
                        to haunt certain places, to protect each city with their unseen presence or
                        under some visible symbol, and to make their abode at each family hearth,
                        uniting all the kindred of the house in a common worship. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The long account of the ‘Games’ in Book V., which, from a Roman point of
                        view, might be regarded as a needless excrescence on the poem, is justified
                        by the consideration that they are celebrated in honour of the Manes of
                        Anchises. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The whole of the Sixth Book—the master-piece of Virgil’s creative
                        invention—is inspired by the feeling of the greater spiritual life which
                        awaits man beyond the grave. The conceptions and composition of that Book
                        entitle Virgil to take his place with Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Plato among
                        the four great religious teachers,—the ‘pii vates’ who, in transmitting,
                        have illumined the spiritual intuitions of antiquity. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sense of devout awe is the chief mark of distinction between the
                        ‘Inferno’ of Virgil and that of Homer, the conception of which is due to the
                        suggestive force of natural curiosity and natural affection. The dead do not
                        appear to Virgil merely as the shadowy inhabitants of an unsubstantial
                        world,—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα</span></span>,—but as partakers in a more august
                        and righteous dispensation than that under which mortals live. The spirit of
                        Virgil is on this subject more in harmony with that of Aeschylus than of
                        Homer, but his thoughts of the dead are happier and of a less austere
                        majesty than those expressed in the Choëphoroe. The whole humanising and
                        moralising influence of Greek philosophy, and especially of the Platonic
                        teaching, combines in Virgil’s representation with the primitive fancies of
                        early times and the popular beliefs and practices transmitted from those
                        times to his own age. But just as he fails to form a consistent conception
                        of the action of the powers of Heaven out of the various beliefs, primitive,
                        artistic, national, and philosophical, which he endeavours to reconcile, so
                        he has failed to produce a consistent picture of the spiritual life out of
                        the various popular, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mystical, and
                        philosophical modes of thought which he strove to combine into a single
                        representation. Perhaps if he had lived longer and been able to carry
                        further the ‘potiora studia’ on which he was engaged simultaneously with the
                        composition of the Aeneid, he might have effected a more specious
                        reconcilement of what now appear irreconcileable factors of belief. Or,
                        perhaps, in the thought which induces him to dismiss Aeneas and the Sibyl by

                        and of unrighteousness, of purity and of impurity, he but reproduces the

                        acquaintance which Virgil shows with the minutiae of Pontifical and Augural
                        lore. It is in keeping with the character of Aeneas as the hero of a
                        religious epic, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the commencement and

                        gods, of the peculiar use of such epithets as ‘eximios’ applied to the bulls
                        selected for sacrifice, of the ritual application of the words

                        the shields and sacred symbols of Mars. Other passages would remind the
                        readers of Virgil of the ceremonial observances with which they were
                        familiar, as for instance that in which Helenus prescribes to Aeneas the

                        life of his countrymen thus appears to have acted as a strong suggestive
                        force to Virgil’s imagination. This is apparent in the importance which he
                        attaches to the offices of Priest or Augur, to the dress, ornaments, or
                        procedure of the chief person taking part in prayer or sacrifice, to the
                        ceremonies accompanying every important action, to the sacred associations
                        attaching to particular places. Amid all the changes of the world, Virgil
                        seems to cling to the traditions of the religious and spiritual life,—as
                        Lucretius holds to the belief in the laws of Nature,—as the surest ground
                        of human trust. He has no thought of superseding old beliefs or practices by

                        its deepest intuitions, it seems to look forward to some aspects of the
                        belief which became dominant in Rome four centuries later. </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While the various religious elements in Virgil’s nature find ample scope in
                        the representation of the Aeneid, his apathy in regard to active political
                        life is seen in the tameness of his reproduction of that aspect of human
                        affairs. In the Homeric <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">βουλή</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">ἀγορά</span></span> we recognise not

                        development of the Greeks, but the germs out of which all free political
                        life unfolds itself. To the form of government exhibited in the Aeneid, the
                        words which Tacitus uses of a mixed constitution might be more justly
                        applied,—‘it is one more easily praised than realised, or if ever it is
                        realised, it is incapable of permanence<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a>.’ And even if the Virgilian idea could be realised in some happy
                        moment of human affairs, it does not contain within itself the capacity of
                        any further development. The difficulties of the problem of government are
                        solved in Virgil by the picture which he draws of passive and loyal
                        submission on the part of nobles and people to a wise, beneficent, and
                        disinterested ruler and legislator<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a>. The idea of the ruler in the Aeneid is
                        the same as that of the ‘Father.’ It is under such a rule, exercised from
                        Rome as its centre, that the unchanging future of the world is anticipated— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The case of Mezentius does indeed show that Virgil recognised the ultimate
                        right of rebellion when the paternal king passed into the tyrannical
                        oppressor; but such an instance affords no scope for representing the
                        manifestation of political passions and virtues. The free play of
                        conflicting forces in a community has no attraction for Virgil’s
                        imagination. He suggests no thought either of the popular liberty realised
                        in the best days of the Roman commonwealth, or of the sagacity and steadfast
                        traditions of the Roman Senate. The only trace of discussion and opposition
                        appears in the debate within the court of Latinus. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>But the antagonism between Drances and Turnus is one of
                        personal rivalry, not of political difference; and the only limit to the
                        sovereignty of Latinus lies in his own weakness of will and in the
                        opposition of his household. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But besides the ideals of popular freedom and senatorian dignity which were
                        realised in the Republic, the Roman mind was impressed by another political
                        ideal, the ‘Majesty of the State.’ The one political force that remained
                        unchanged, amid the various changes of the Roman constitution from the time
                        of the kings to the time of the emperors, was the power of the executive.
                        And this power depended not on material force, but on the sentiment with
                        which the magistrate was regarded as the embodiment for the time being of
                        that attribute in the State which commanded the reverence of the people. The
                        greatest political offence which a Roman could commit under the Republic was
                        a violation of the ‘majesty of the Commonwealth;’ under the Empire ‘of the
                        majesty of the Emperor.’ The sentiment out of which this idea arose was felt
                        by Virgil in all its strength. Thus although the actual government of
                        Latinus is exhibited as a model neither of wisdom nor of strength, it is
                        invested with all the outward semblance of powerful and ancient
                        sovereignty— </p>

                        reipublicae’ prevented Virgil, in his representation, from appealing to the
                        generous political emotions of a free people, he was able not only to
                        gratify the pride of empire felt by his countrymen, but to sustain among
                        them the sense of imaginative reverence with which the sovereignty of the
                        State over its individual members deserves to be regarded. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there is another class of political facts which interest the mind as
                        much as those which arise out of the play of conflicting forces within a
                        free commonwealth,—viz. the relations of independent powers with one
                        another. And of this class of facts both Homer and Virgil make use in their
                        representations. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Homer we see the
                        spectacle, never realised in actual Grecian history at least till the days
                        of Alexander, of the many independent Greek powers united under one leader
                        in a common enterprise, and of the various powers of the western shores of
                        Asia combined in defence of their leading State. The antagonism between the
                        Greeks and Trojans is, in point of general conception, more like the hostile
                        inter-relations of nations in modern times, than like the wars of city
                        against city, with which the pages of later Greek history are filled<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a>. The union of the Italian tribes and cities under the
                        command of Turnus, and that of Trojans, Arcadians, and Etrurians—all
                        foreigners recently settled in Italy—under Aeneas, may be compared to the
                        union of independent Greek powers under Agamemnon, and that of ‘the allies
                        summoned from afar,’ who, while following their own princes, yet submitted
                        to the command of Hector. Yet in Virgil’s conception of the great powers of
                        the world, and even of cities most remote from one another, as having an
                        intimate knowledge of each other’s fortunes,—in the idea of what in modern
                        times would be called a ‘foreign policy’ and ‘the balance of power,’ which
                        dictates the mission of Turnus to Diomede, and the appeal of Aeneas to the
                        Etrurians to take part with him in averting the establishment by the
                        Rutulians of a sovereignty over the whole of Italy,—we meet with a
                        condition of international relations and policy, which, if based on the
                        experience of any period of ancient history, might have been suggested by
                        the memory of the time when Hannibal’s great scheme of combining the fresh
                        vigour of the western barbarians, the smouldering elements of resistance in
                        Italy, and the military power and prestige of the old monarchies of
                        Macedonia and Syria, was defeated not more by the irresolution and disunion
                        among those powers, than by the traditional policy through which Rome had
                        made her dependent allies feel that her interest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was identified with their own. But this aspect of the world,
                        though an anachronism from the point of view either of the time when the
                        poem was written, or of that in which the events represented are supposed to
                        happen, enhances the dignity of the action, by exhibiting the enterprise of
                        Aeneas as a spectacle attracting the attention and involving the destinies
                        of the great nations of the world. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The state of material civilisation exhibited in the Aeneid must be regarded
                        also as a poetical compromise between the simplicity and rude vigour of
                        primitive civilisation and the splendour and refinement of the age in which
                        the poem was written. Thus Acestes, the friendly king and Sicilian host of
                        Aeneas, welcomes him on his return from Carthage in the rough dress of some
                        primitive hunter— </p>

                        Alcinous)—appear to owe their existence to the impression produced on the
                        mind of Virgil by some of the great architectural works of the Augustan
                        Age—such as the Theatre of Marcellus, the Pantheon, the Temple of the
                        Palatine Apollo, and by the spectacle of profuse luxury which the houses and
                        banquets of the richer classes at Rome exhibited. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The class from which the personages of the Aeneid are taken is almost
                        exclusively that of those most elevated in dignity and influence. Virgil
                        does not attempt to bring before us the rich variety of social grades, which
                        adds vivacity and verisimilitude to the spectacle of life and manners
                        presented by Homer, Chaucer, and Shakspeare. It does not enter into Virgil’s
                        conception of epic art to introduce types of the class to which Thersites,
                        Irus, Eumaeus, Phemius, and Eurycleia belong. If he makes any exception to
                        his general practice of limiting his representation to the class of royal
                        and noble <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>personages, it is in the glimpse
                        which he affords of devoted loyalty in the person of Palinurus and of
                        affection and grief in that of the bereaved mother of Euryalus. Where, after
                        the example of Homer, he introduces various figures belonging to the same
                        class, he fails to distinguish them from one another by any individual trait
                        of character or manners. Thus Dido has her suitors as well as Penelope; but
                        the former produce no life-like impression of any kind, like that produced
                        by the careless levity and gay insolence of Antinous and Eurymachus. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As a painter of manners Virgil adopts the stately and conventional methods
                        of Greek tragedy rather than the vivid realism of Homer. The intercourse of
                        his chief personages with one another is conducted with the dignity and
                        courtesy of the most refined times. Homer’s personages indeed act for the
                        most part with a natural dignity and courtesy of bearing,—proceeding from
                        the commanding character which he attributes to them, as well as from the
                        lively social grace of their Greek origin,—which can neither be surpassed
                        nor equalled by any conventional refinement. But these social virtues can be

                        manners of Virgil’s personages we recognise the influence of refined
                        traditions, and of the habits of a dignified society. His personages show
                        not only courtesy but studied consideration for each other. Thus while

                        which he borrows most closely from his original. But the life-like realism,
                        the combined humour and terror of Homer’s representation, are altogether
                        absent from the Aeneid. These marvellous creations appear natural in the

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet even in the incidents of his battle-pieces Virgil does not follow Homer
                        slavishly. The warlike action of the poem is not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a mere succession of single combats, or a confused <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mêlée</span></span> of battle, surging ‘this way and that,’ between
                        the rampart that guards the ships and the walls of the city. It is said that
                        the greatest soldier of modern times, in the enforced leisure of his last
                        years, condescended to express a criticism, not indeed a favourable one, on
                        Virgil’s skill as a tactician; and it is an element of novelty in the
                        representation of the Aeneid that it suggests at least some image of the
                        combined operations of modern warfare. But it is in the play which Virgil
                        gives to the other human emotions of his personages, tempering and
                        counteracting the blind rage of battle, that the poet of a more advanced era
                        most conspicuously appears. The ancient world at its best, whether we judge
                        of it from the representations of its poets, or the recorded acts of its
                        greatest men and most powerful and enlightened States, did not rise to that
                        height of chivalrous generosity which scorns to take an enemy at a
                        disadvantage, or to wipe away the memory of defeat or disaster by a cruel
                        revenge. Achilles in his treatment of Hector, Caesar in his treatment of
                        Vercingetorix, the Spartans in dealing with Plataeae, the Syracusans with
                        the remnant of the defeated Athenians, the Athenians themselves with the
                        helpless defenders of Melos, the Romans with the Samnites who spared their
                        lives at the Caudine Forks,—all alike fall below the standard of nobleness
                        which men of temper inferior to that of the great men and nations of
                        antiquity often reached in mediaeval times. Those who appear to come nearest
                        this standard in ancient times,—who could at least honour courage in an
                        enemy or refuse to press too heavily upon him in his defeat,—are the
                        Carthaginian Hannibal and his not unworthy conqueror. Virgil cannot be said,
                        in this respect, to rise altogether superior to the spirit of the old Greek
                        and Roman world. In the Aeneid it is thought no shame, but rather a glory,
                        for soldiers to slay defenceless or wounded men in battle or in the dim
                        confusion of a night foray. Yet the sentiments of his warriors engaged in
                        battle are more tempered with humanity than those of the heroes of the
                        Iliad. There is no word of throwing the bodies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the slain to dogs and vultures. There is no such deadly
                        struggle over the bodies of Lausus or Pallas as over that of Patroclus.
                        Turnus and Aeneas alike act on the principle expressed in the request of the
                        dying champion of Italy,— </p>

                        forgetting in the supposed interests of religion the certain claims of
                        humanity, is that in which Aeneas, following the example of Achilles, sets

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The personal and national susceptibilities of Virgil’s imagination and the
                        circumstances of the age in which he lived are thus seen largely to modify
                        that representation of life and manners of which the main outlines are
                        suggested by the Homeric poems, and of which many of the details are derived
                        from the Cyclic poems, from the Greek tragedies founded on the events which
                        followed on the death of Hector, and from the Italian traditions and
                        aetiological myths which Cato had preserved in his ‘Origines,’ and Varro and
                        other writers in their works on antiquities. Virgil’s power as an epic poet
                        does not consist in original invention of incident or action, but in
                        combining diverse elements into a homogeneous whole, and in imparting poetic
                        life to old materials, many of them not originally conceived in a poetic
                        spirit. The interest which he thus imparts to his narrative is different
                        from, and inferior to, that attaching to the original representation in the
                        Homeric poems. Had Virgil’s representation been as faithfully drawn from the
                        life as that of Homer, it still would have been less interesting, from the
                        fact that ancient Romans are less interesting in their individuality than
                        the Greeks of the great ages of Greek life, and from the fact also that the
                        manners of an advanced age do not affect the imagination in the way in which
                        those of a nation’s youth affect it. Not only was Virgil’s own genius much
                        less creative than that of Homer, his materials possessed much less
                        plasticity. There is no need of any act of reconstructive criticism to
                        enable us to feel the immediate power of the Iliad and the Odyssey. To do
                        justice to the power of the Aeneid we must endeavour to realise in
                        imagination the state of mind of those who received the poem in all the
                        novelty of its first impression,—at once ‘rich with the spoils of time,’
                        and ‘pregnant with celestial fire.’ </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The most important element in the Aeneid, regarded as a poem of heroic
                        action, remains still to be considered, viz. the conception and delineation
                        of individual character. The greatest of epic poets in ancient times was
                        also endowed with the most versatile dramatic faculty. And this faculty was
                        displayed not only in the conception of a great variety of noble types of
                        character, but also in the modes in which these conceptions were embodied.
                        The Greek language is greatly superior to the Latin in its adaptability to
                        natural dialogue. In this respect Cicero’s inferiority to Plato is as marked
                        as Virgil’s inferiority to Homer. The language of Homer and the language of
                        Plato are equally fitted for the expression of the greatest thoughts and
                        feelings, and for the common intercourse of men with one another. Neither
                        that of Virgil nor of Cicero adapts itself easily to the lively play of
                        emotion or to the rapid interchange of thought. The characters of Homer,
                        like the characters of Shakspeare, reveal themselves in their complete
                        individuality, as they act and re-act on one another in many changing moods
                        of passion and affection. The personages of Virgil are revealed by the poet,
                        partly in his account of what they do, and partly through the medium of set
                        speeches expressive of some particular attitude of mind. Virgil’s
                        imagination is the imagination of the orator rather than of the dramatist.
                        It is not a complete and complex man, liable to various moods, and standing

                        express. Milton also, like Virgil, reveals the characters of his personages
                        with the imaginative power of an orator rather than with that of a
                        dramatist. But he possesses another resource in the analytical power with
                        which he makes his chief personage reveal his inmost nature and most secret
                        motives in truthful communing with himself. It is through the soliloquies in
                        the ‘Paradise Lost’ that we can best realise the whole conception of Satan,
                        in his ruined mag<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nificence, and in his lost
                        but not forgotten capacity of happiness and nobleness. The soliloquies of
                        these personages perform for the epic poet the part performed by the
                        elaborate introspection and discussion of motives in modern prose fiction.
                        Homer also avails himself frequently of the soliloquy, as he does of natural
                        dialogue and more formal oratory. In the Aeneid the chief personage is often
                        introduced, like the heroes of the Iliad and Odyssey, </p>

                        conflicting duties or probabilities, of the obvious course indicated by some
                        supernatural sign. The soliloquies of Dido are to be regarded rather as
                        passionate outbursts of prayer to some unknown avenging power than as

                        us less varied and flexible than those of Homer, but the characters
                        themselves are more tamely conceived, and less capable of awakening human
                        interest. And this is especially true of the character of Aeneas as
                        contrasted with those of Achilles and of Odysseus. The general conception of
                        Aeneas is indeed in keeping with the religious idea of the Aeneid. He is
                        intended to be an embodiment of the courage of an ancient hero, the justice
                        of a paternal ruler, the mild humanity of a cultivated man living in an age
                        of advanced civilisation, the saintliness of the founder of a new <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>religion of peace and pure observance, the
                        affection for parent and child, which was one of the strongest instincts in
                        the Italian race. A life-like impersonation of such an ideal would have
                        commanded the reverence of all future times. Yet at no time has the
                        character of Aeneas excited any strong human interest. No later poet or
                        moralist set it up, as Horace sets up the characters of Achilles and of
                        Ulysses, as a subject of ethical contemplation. Ovid in the deepest gloom of
                        his exile retains enough of his old levity to jest at his single lapse from

                        attributed solely to a failure of power in the poet’s imagination. In the
                        part he plays he is conceived of as one chosen by the supreme purpose of the
                        gods, as an instrument of their will, and thus necessarily unmoved by
                        ordinary human <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impulses. In the words of M.
                        de Coulanges, ‘Sa vertu doit être une froide et haute impersonnalité, qui
                        fasse de lui, non un homme, mais un instrument des dieux<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>.’ The strength required in such an instrument
                        is the strength of faith, submission, patience, and endurance; and it is
                        with this strength that Aeneas encounters the many dangers and vicissitudes
                        to which he is exposed, and withdraws from the allurements of ease and
                        pleasure. The very virtues of his character act as a check rather than as a
                        stimulus to those natural impulses out of which the most living
                        impersonations are formed. To compare great things in art with what are not
                        so great, the impression produced by the superiority of Aeneas to ordinary
                        passion is like the impression produced by the superior tolerance and
                        enlightenment of some of Scott’s heroes, when contrasted with the more
                        animated impulses and ruder fanaticism of the other personages in his story.
                        That he is, on the one hand, the passive receptacle of Divine guidance, and,
                        on the other, the impersonation of a modern ideal of humanity, playing a
                        part in a rude and turbulent time, are the two main causes of the tame and
                        colourless character of the protagonist of the Aeneid. And as loyalty to a
                        leader is the sole form of political, as distinct from patriotic virtue
                        which Virgil acknowledges, the other Trojan chiefs—the faithful Achates,
                        the speaker Idomeneus, the more martial figures of Mnestheus and
                        Serestus—do little more than play the part of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">ἄγγελος</span></span> or of

                        wrong done to her and Turnus by the enforced severance of their affections.
                        Amata exhibits the blind animal rage of a mother whose affections have been
                        outraged, but her figure wants the firm outlines and substance of the Hecuba
                        of the Iliad. The prophetic office of Helenus enables him to advance the
                        action of the story by preparing the mind of Aeneas for his immediate
                        future: the jealous interference of Iarbas accelerates the doom of Dido:
                        Acestes performs the part of a kindly host to the Trojans in Sicily. But of
                        any individual traits of character they exhibit no trace whatever. Drances
                        serves as a vehicle of impassioned oratory, and as a kind of foil to the
                        generous impulsiveness of Turnus—just as the timid craft of Arruns is a
                        foil to the splendid rashness of Camilla;—and perhaps he is not much less
                        real to our imaginations than Polydamus, who is the only personage of the
                        Iliad that we think of rather as the embodiment of an abstract <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>quality,—moderation,—than as a living man. But
                        in the delineation of Drances there is no sign of that power which, by a few
                        graphic strokes of description and the force of dramatic insight, has made
                        Thersites stand forth for all times as the type of an envious and ignoble
                        demagogue. Though there is more effort of thought in the delineation of
                        Latinus as swayed to and fro by his religious sense of duty and the
                        influence of others, and though there is true pathos in the words with which
                        he allows the declaration of war to be made— </p>

                        compassion which the grief of Priam awakens in the last books of the Iliad.
                        Perhaps the most impressive of the secondary personages in the Aeneid is
                        Evander, as he appears in the dignity of his simple state in the eighth
                        Book, and in the dignity of his great sorrow in the eleventh. Pallas and
                        Lausus, Nisus and Euryalus, afford occasions for pathetic situations, rather
                        than perform any part affording scope for the display of character. The
                        romantic career of Camilla interests us; and she has the further attraction
                        to modern readers of reminding them of a martial heroine of actual history:
                        but we scarcely recognise in the vivid delineation of her deeds those
                        complex elements which in their union form a whole character for our
                        imaginations, whether in the representations of literature or in our
                        experience of life. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chief personal interest of the story is centred in those whose fortunes
                        and action bring them into antagonism with the decrees of Fate, and who
                        perish in consequence,—in Turnus, Mezentius, and Dido. Patriotism, courage,
                        and passion are exhibited in a fatal but not ignoble struggle with the
                        purposes and chosen instruments of Omnipotence. The tragic interest of this
                        antagonism stimulates the imagination of the poet to a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more energetic delineation of character. And in the
                        representation of this struggle it is quite true, as has been well shown by
                        Mr. Nettleship, that Virgil’s own sympathies go with the ‘victrix causa’
                        which ‘pleased the gods,’ not with the ‘victa’ which pleases our modern
                        sensibilities. He professes not to question but </p>

                        Turnus brings his doom upon himself by the intemperate vehemence and
                        self-confidence with which he asserts his personal claims. Though Aeneas and
                        Dido are both represented as ‘forgetful of their better name,’ yet, as
                        happens in real life more generally than in fiction, it is the woman only
                        who suffers the penalty of this forgetfulness. Yet though in all these cases
                        the doom of the sufferers is brought about in part through their own fault,
                        Virgil does not, as an inferior artist might do, endeavour to augment the
                        sympathy with his chief personage, by an unworthy detraction from his
                        antagonist. No scorn of treachery or cowardice, no indignation against
                        cruelty, mingles with the feeling of admiration which the general bearing of
                        Turnus excites. The basis of his character seems to be a generous vehemence
                        and proud independence of spirit. If Aeneas typifies the civilising mission
                        of Rome and is to be regarded as an embodiment of the qualities which
                        enabled her to give law to the world, Turnus typifies the brave but not
                        internecine resistance offered to her by the other races of Italy, and is an
                        embodiment of their high and martial spirit—of that ‘Itala virtus’ which,
                        when tempered by Roman discipline, gave Rome the strength to fulfil her
                        mission. The cause which moves Turnus to resist the Trojans is no unworthy
                        one, either on patriotic grounds or on grounds personal to himself. If the
                        Greeks were justified in making war against the Trojans on account of Helen,
                        the Italians may be justified in making war against the same people on
                        account of Lavinia. His appeals to his countrymen are addressed to the most
                        elemental of patriotic impulses— </p>

                        deprived of the consolation of his funeral honours. Although the headlong
                        vehemence of his own nature, no less than his opposition to the beneficent
                        purposes of Omnipotence, seems to justify his fate, yet, as in the Ajax of
                        Sophocles, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">αὐθαδία</span></span> in Turnus is rather the flaw in an
                        essentially heroic temper, than his dominant characteristic. The poet’s
                        sympathy with the high spirit of youth, as manifested in love and war, and
                        his pride in the strong metal out of which the Italian race was made, have
                        led him, perhaps involuntarily, to an embodiment of those chivalrous
                        qualities, which affect the modern imagination with more powerful sympathy
                        than the qualities of a temperate will and obedience to duty which he has
                        striven to embody in the representation of Aeneas. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The vigorous sketch of Mezentius, as he appears in Book x., has received
                        from some critics more admiration than the sustained delineation of Turnus
                        through all the vicissitudes of feeling and fortune through which he passes.
                        Chateaubriand says, that this figure is the only one in the Aeneid that is
                        ‘fièrement dessinée.’ Landor describes him as ‘the hero transcendently above
                        all others in the Aeneid.’ And there is certainly a vague grandeur of
                        outline in this conception of the ‘contemptor divom’ and oppressor of his
                        people, who is ‘not only the most passionate in his grief for Lausus, but
                        likewise <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gives way to manly sorrow for the
                        mute companion of his warfare,’ indicative of a bolder invention than that
                        which is usually ascribed to Virgil. It is remarkable that poets whose
                        spirit is most purely religious,—both in the strength of conviction and the
                        limitation of sympathy produced by the religious spirit—Aeschylus, Virgil,
                        and Milton—seem to be moved to their most energetic creativeness by the
                        idea of antagonism to the supreme will on the part of a human, or superhuman
                        but limited will: and that they cannot help raising in their readers a glow
                        of admiration as well as a sense of awe in their embodiment of this clash
                        between finite and infinite power. The sketch of Mezentius cannot indeed be
                        compared with two of the most daring conceptions and perfected creations of
                        human genius,—the Prometheus of Aeschylus and the Satan of Milton,—yet, if
                        it does not enlist our ethical sympathies like the former of these, like the
                        second it receives the tribute of that involuntary admiration, which is
                        given to courage, even when allied with moral evil, so long as it is not
                        absolutely divorced from the capability of sympathetic and elevated emotion. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the part which Dido plays in the poem, Virgil finds a source of interest
                        in which he had not been anticipated by Homer. And although the passion of
                        love, unreturned or betrayed, had supplied a motive to the later Greek
                        tragedy and to the Alexandrine epic, it was still not impossible for a new
                        poet to represent this phase of modern life with more power and pathos than
                        any of his predecessors. It was comparatively easy to produce a more noble
                        and vital impersonation than the Medea of Apollonius. But the Dido of Virgil
                        may compare favourably with the creations of greater masters,—with the
                        Deianeira of Sophocles, with the Phaedra and the Medea of Euripides. And
                        Virgil’s conception is at once more impassioned than that of Sophocles, and
                        nobler and more womanly than those of Euripides. Her character, as it is
                        represented before the disturbing influence of this new passion produced by
                        supernatural artifice, is that of a brave <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and loyal, a great and queenly, a pure, trusting, and compassionate
                        nature. The most tragic element in the development of her love for Aeneas is
                        the struggle which it involves with her high-strung sense of fidelity to the
                        dead— </p>

                        had attended her own enterprise. When by the unsuspected agency of the two
                        goddesses she has been possessed by the fatal passion, it is to no ignoble
                        influence that she succumbs. It is the greatness and renown of one whom she
                        recognises as of the race of the gods, which exercise a spell over her

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That the passion of Dido is powerfully conceived and delineated, that it
                        satisfies modern feeling more legitimately than the representation of the
                        unhallowed impulses of Phaedra, or of the cruel and treacherous rancour of
                        Medea, will scarcely be questioned. Yet perhaps it is doing no injustice to
                        the genius of Virgil to say that his power in dealing with human life
                        consists generally in conceiving some state of feeling, some pathetic or
                        passionate situation, rather than in the creation and sustained development
                        of living characters. How the great impersonations of poetry and prose
                        fiction, which are more real to our imaginations than the personages of
                        history or those whom we know in life, come into being, is a question which
                        probably their authors themselves could not answer. Though reflexion on
                        human nature and deliberate intention to exemplify some law of life may
                        precede the creative act which gives them being, and though continued
                        reflexion may be needed to sustain <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them in
                        a consistent course, yet no mere analytic insight into the springs of action
                        can explain the process by which a great artist works. The beings of his
                        imagination seem to acquire an existence independent of the experience and
                        of the deliberate intentions of their author, and to inform this experience
                        and mould these intentions as much as they are informed and moulded by them.
                        Virgil’s imagination in the creation of Dido seems to be possessed in this
                        way. She grows more and more real as her passion deepens. Virgil’s intention
                        in this representation may have been to show the tragic infatuation of a
                        woman’s love— </p>
                    <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> but his sympathetic insight into this passion—an insight already shown in
                        the Eclogues—stimulates the forces of his imagination to a nobler as well
                        as a more vital creation than in any other of his impersonations. Dido ranks
                        for all times as one of the great heroines of poetry. So long as she appears
                        on the scene the interest in the exhibition of her nature overpowers all
                        other interests. But this is not the case with Virgil’s other personages. We
                        are more interested in what they say and in what happens to them than in
                        what they are. In other words, it is by his oratorical and descriptive,
                        rather than by his dramatic faculty, that he secures the attention of his
                        readers. As oratory was one of the most important powers in ancient life, so
                        it became a prominent element in ancient epic and dramatic poetry,—in
                        Homer, Ennius, and Virgil, as well as in Sophocles, Euripides, and the Roman
                        tragedians. The oratory of the Aeneid shows nothing of the speculative
                        power—of the application of great ideas to life—which gives the
                        profoundest value not only to many speeches in Sophocles, but also to some
                        of those in the Iliad, and notably to such as proceed from the mouth of
                        Odysseus. It cannot equal the vivid naturalness of the speeches of Nestor,
                        nor the impassioned grandeur of those of Achilles. Neither is it
                        characterised by the subtle psychological analysis which is the most
                        interesting quality in the rhetoric of Euripides. On the other hand, it is
                        not disfigured <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by the forensic special
                        pleading and word-fencing which is an occasional flaw in the dramatic art of
                        Sophocles, and a pervading mannerism in that of the younger poet. The
                        impression of grave political deliberation is left on the mind by some of
                        the fragments of Ennius more effectually than by anything uttered in the
                        councils of gods or men in the Aeneid. But it is in the greatest of modern
                        epics that the full force of intellect and feeling animating grave councils
                        of state is most grandly idealised. The speeches in Virgil, though they want
                        the intellectual power and the majestic largeness of utterance of those in
                        Milton, are, like his, stately and dignified in expression; they are
                        disfigured by no rhetorical artifice of fine-spun argument or exaggerated
                        emphasis; they are rapid with the vehemence of scorn and indignation, fervid
                        with martial pride and enthusiasm, or, occasionally, weighty with the power
                        of controlled emotion. They have the ring of Roman oratory, as it is heard
                        in the animated declamation of Livy, and sometimes seem to anticipate the
                        reserved force and ‘imperial brevity’ of Tacitus. They give a true voice to
                        ‘the high, magnanimous Roman mood,’ and to the fervour of spirit with which
                        that mood was associated. And this effect is sometimes increased by the use
                        which the polished poet of the Augustan Age makes of the grave, ardent, but
                        unformed utterances—‘rudes et inconditae voces’—of the epic and tragic
                        poets of the Republic. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The descriptive faculty of Virgil is quite unlike that of Homer, but yet it
                        has great excellences of its own. In the Iliad and Odyssey man appears
                        ‘vigorous and elastic such as poetry saw him first, such as poetry would
                        ever see him<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a>;’ and the outward
                        world is described in the clear forms and the animated movement which
                        impress themselves immediately on the sense and mind of men thus happily
                        organised. Virgil too presents to us the varied spectacle of human life and
                        of the outward world under many impressive aspects. But these aspects of
                        things do not affect the mind with the immediate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impulse which the natural man receives from them, and of
                        which he retains the vivid picture in his mind. As in his pastoral poems and
                        in the Georgics Virgil seems to abstract from the general aspect of things
                        the characteristic sentiment which Nature inspires in particular places and
                        at particular times, and to see the scene which he describes under the
                        influence of that sentiment, so in the Aeneid various human ‘situations’ are
                        conceived under the influence of some sense of awe or wonder, of beauty or
                        pathos, of local or antique association; and the whole description is so
                        presented as to bring this central interest into prominent relief. The
                        thought of the whole situation, not the sequence of events in time or causal
                        connexion, is what determines the grouping and subordination of details. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus in the description of the storm in Book i., the dominant feeling by the
                        light of which the circumstances are to be realised is that of sudden and
                        overwhelming power in the elements and of man’s impotence to contend against
                        them. In the description of the harbour in which the ships of Aeneas find
                        refuge we feel the sense of calm and peace after storm and danger. In the
                        interview between Venus and her son the impression left on the mind is that
                        of a mysterious supernatural grace enhancing the charm of human beauty, such
                        as is produced by the pictorial representations of religious art. We seem to
                        look on the rising towers and dwellings of Carthage with that joyful sense
                        of wonder and novelty with which the thought of the beginning of great
                        enterprises, or of the discovery of unknown lands, and the first view of
                        ancient and famous cities, such as Rome or Venice, appeal to the
                        imagination. In the second Book the effect of the whole representation is
                        enhanced by the sentiment of awe and mystery with which night, and darkness,
                        and the intermittent flashes of light which break the darkness, impress the
                        mind. Thus as a prelude to the terrible and tragical scenes afterwards
                        represented, the apparition of Hector comes before Aeneas in the deepest
                        stillness of the night— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the employment of illustrative imagery Virgil is much more sparing than
                        Homer. The varied forces of Nature and of animal life supplied materials to
                        the Greek poet by which to enhance the poetical sense of the situation which
                        he de<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scribes; and all these forces are
                        apprehended by him with a vivid feeling of wonder, and presented to the
                        imagination with a truthful observation of outward signs, and with a
                        sympathetic insight into their innermost nature. Virgil is not only more
                        sparing in the use of these figures; he is also tamer and less inventive in
                        their application. In those drawn from the life of wild animals he, for the
                        most part, reproduces the Homeric imagery, though we note as one touch of
                        realism in them that the wolf, familiar to Italy, frequently takes the place
                        of the lion, which was probably still an object of terror in Western Asia at
                        the time when Homer lived. Another class of images reproduced from Homer is
                        that of those in which a mortal is compared to an immortal, as at i. 498— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There is, however, another class of ‘similes’ used by Virgil in his epic,
                        after the example of the Alexandrines, which can scarcely be said to fulfil
                        the function of a poetical analogy, but merely to give a realistic outward
                        symbol of some movement of the mind or passions, without any imaginative
                        enhancement of the situation. Such, for instance, is the comparison at vii.
                        377, etc. of the mind of Amata to a top whipped by boys round an empty
                        court,—a comparison suggested by a passage in Callimachus<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href="#note_674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a>; and that again at viii. 22, etc. of
                        the variations of purpose in the mind of Aeneas, produced by the surging sea
                        of cares besetting him, to the variations of light reflected from the water
                        in a copper cauldron,—a comparison directly imitated from Apollonius (iii.

                        may be called a somewhat conventional cast, which acquire individuality from

                        invention, observation, and reflexion, which serve the true purpose of
                        imaginative analogies, viz. that of exalting the peculiar sentiment with
                        which the poet desires the situation he is describing to be regarded. In the
                        perception of these analogies it is not merely intellectual curiosity that
                        is gratified by the apprehension of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">τοῦτο ἐκεῖνο</span></span> in the
                        phenomena; but the imagination is enlarged by the recognition of analogous
                        forces operating in different spheres, which separately are capable of
                        producing a vivid and noble emotion. As an instance of this perception of
                        the analogy between great forces in different spheres, the one of human, the
                        other of natural activity, we may take the comparison of the Italian host
                        advancing in orderly march after its tumultuous gathering from many

                        the image to the sudden recognition by Aeneas of the pale and shadowy form
                        of his forsaken love, dimly discerned through the gloom of the lower world.
                        Other images are suggested by the poet’s delicate sense of grace in flower

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Had Virgil lived to devote three more years to the revisal of his work,
                        there is no reason to suppose that he would have added anything to its
                        substance. Some inconsistencies of statement, as, for instance, that between
                        iii. 256 and vii. 123, would have disappeared, and some difficulties would
                        have been cleared up. But the chief part of the ‘limae labor’ would have
                        been employed in bringing the rhythm and diction of the poem to a more
                        finished perfection than that which they exhibit at present. The unfinished
                        lines in the poem would certainly have been completed and more closely
                        connected with the passages immediately succeeding them. There is no
                        indication that these lines were left purposely incomplete in order to give
                        emphasis to some pause in the narrative. Virgil was the last poet likely to
                        avail himself of so inartistic an innovation to give variety to his
                        cadences. For the most part they appear to be weak props (‘tibicines’<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a>) used provisionally to fill up the gap
                        between two passages, and indicating but not completing the thought that was
                        to connect them. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What more of elegance, of compact structure, or of varied harmony Virgil
                        might have imparted to his rhythm, it is impossible to determine. We might
                        conjecture that his aim <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would have been, as
                        regards both expression and metrical effect, to act on the maxim ‘ramos
                        compesce fluentes,’ than to give them ampler scope. In a long narrative poem
                        like the Aeneid that perfect smoothness and solidity of rhythmical execution
                        which characterise the Georgics—in which poem the position and weight of
                        each single word in each single line is an element contributing to the whole
                        effect—is hardly to be expected. A narrative poem demands a more easy,
                        varied, and even careless movement than one of which the interest is
                        contemplative, and which requires to be studied minutely line by line and
                        paragraph by paragraph, before its full meaning is realised. If the movement
                        in the Aeneid appears in some place rougher, or less compact, or more
                        languid than in others, this may be explained not only by the imperfect
                        state in which the poem was left, but by the difficulty or impossibility of
                        maintaining the same uniform level of elevation in so long a flight. Yet it
                        cannot be said that there is any loss of power, any trace of contentment
                        with a lower ideal of perfection in the general structure of the verse of
                        the Aeneid. The full capacities of the Latin hexameter for purposes of
                        animated or impressive narrative, of solemn or pathetic representation, of
                        grave or impassioned oratory, of tender, dignified, or earnest appeal to the
                        higher emotions of man, are realised in many passages of the poem. Virgil’s
                        instrument fails, or, at least, is much inferior to Homer’s, in aptitude for
                        natural dialogue or for bringing familiar things in the freshness of
                        immediate impression before the imagination. The stateliness of movement

                        and fulness of volume to that of Milton in his passages of most sustained
                        power; but it is easier and less encumbered and thus more adapted to express
                        various conditions of human life than the ordinary movement of the modern
                        epic. It flows in a more varied, weighty, and self-restrained stream than
                        the more homogeneous and overflowing current of Spenser’s verse. The Latin
                        hexameter became for Virgil an exquisite and powerful medium for
                        communicating to others a knowledge of his elevated moods and pensive
                        meditativeness, and for calling up before their minds that spectacle of a
                        statelier life and a more august order in the contemplation of which his
                        spirit habitually lived. </p>
                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The last revision would also have removed from the poem some redundancies,
                        obscurities, and weakness of expression. There is a greater tendency to use
                        ‘otiose’ epithets than in the Georgics, and a minute criticism has taken
                        note of the number of times in which such words as ‘ingens’ and ‘immanis’
                        occur in the poem. Though the interpretation of the meaning of the Aeneid as
                        a whole is probably as certain as that of any other great work of antiquity,
                        yet there are passages in it which still baffle commentators in deciding
                        which of two or three possible meanings was in the mind of the poet, or
                        whether he had himself finally resolved what turn he should give his
                        thought. As there are lines left incomplete, so there are lame conclusions
                        to lofty and impassioned utterances of feeling. Such for instance is the
                        prosaic and tautological conclusion of the passage in which Lausus is
                        brought on the scene— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But it is only a microscopic observation of the structure of the poem that
                        detects such blemishes as these. In the Aeneid <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Virgil’s style appears as great in its power of reaching the
                        secrets of the human spirit, as in the Georgics it proved itself to be in
                        eliciting the deeper meaning of Nature. He combines nearly all the
                        characteristic excellences of the great Latin writers. His language appears
                        indeed inferior not only to that of Lucretius and Catullus but even to that
                        of Ennius in reproducing the first vivid impressions of things upon the
                        mind. The phrases of Virgil are generally coloured with the associations and
                        steeped in the feeling of older thoughts and memories. Yet if he seems
                        inferior in direct force of presentation, he unites the two most marked and
                        generally dissociated characteristics of the masters of Latin style,—the
                        exuberance and vivacity of those writers in whom impulse and imagination are
                        strong, such as Cicero, Livy, and Lucretius,—the terseness and compactness
                        of expression, arising either from intensity of perception or reflective
                        condensation, of which the shorter poems of Catullus, the Odes and Epistles
                        of Horace, the writings of Sallust, and the memorial inscriptions of the
                        time of the Republic and of the Empire afford striking examples. Virgil’s
                        condensation of expression often resembles that of Tacitus, and seems to
                        arise from the same cause, the restraint imposed by reflexion on the
                        exuberance of a poetical imagination. By its combination of opposite
                        excellences the style of the Aeneid is at once an admirable vehicle of
                        continuous or compressed narrative, of large or concentrated description, of
                        fluent and impassioned, or composed and impressive oratory. It possesses
                        also the power, which distinguishes the older Latin writers, of stamping
                        some grave or magnanimous lesson in imperishable characters on the mind— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Virgil is not only great as a Latin writer. The concurrent testimony of
                        the most refined minds of all times marks him out as one of the greatest
                        masters of the language which touches the heart or moves the manlier
                        sensibilities, who has ever lived. A mature and mellow truth of sentiment, a
                        conformity to the deeper experiences of life in every age, a fine humanity
                        as well as a generous elevation of feeling, and some magical charm of music
                        in his words, have enabled them to serve many minds in many ages as a symbol
                        of some swelling thought or over-mastering emotion, the force and meaning of
                        which they could scarcely define to themselves. A striking instance of this
                        effect appears in the words in which Savonarola describes the impulse which
                        forced him to abandon the career of worldly ambition, which his father
                        pressed on him, in favour of the religious life. It was the voice of warning
                        which he ever heard repeating to him the words— </p>

                    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And while his tenderness of feeling has made Virgil the familiar friend of
                        one class of minds, his high magnanimous spirit has equally gained for him
                        the admiration of another class. The words of no other poet, ancient or
                        modern, have been so often heard in the great debates of the English
                        Parliament, which more than any other deliberations among men have
                        reproduced the dignified and masculine eloquence familiar to the Roman
                        Senate. One of the greatest masters of expression among living English
                        writers has pointed, as characteristic of the magic of Virgil’s style, to
                        ‘his single words and phrases, his pathetic half-lines giving utterance, as
                        the voice of Nature herself, to that pain and weariness yet hope of better
                        things which is the experience of her children in every time<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a>.’ It is in

                        deep longing for rest, in making others feel his own sense of the painful
                        toil and mystery of life and of the sadness of death, his sense too of vague
                        yearning for some fuller and ampler being, that Virgil produces the most
                        powerful effect by the use of the simplest words in their simplest
                        application. </p>

                                of Tarentum. But, at
                            the time when Propertius wrote, Virgil was engaged in the composition of
                            the Aeneid, not of the Eclogues. The present ‘canis’ seems rather to
                            mean that Virgil, while engaged with his Aeneid, was still conning over
                            his old Eclogues. Yet he must have strayed ‘subter pineta Galaesi’ some
                            time before the composition of the last Georgic. It has been remarked by
                            Mr. Munro that the ‘memini’ in the line <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                            inheritance into the possession of Virgil, and was he in later life in
                            the habit of going to it from time to time? or was the distance too
                            great from Mantua for him to have transferred his family

                            sense which has generally been attached to it, as a means of reviving

                            such an episode as the ‘Pastor Aristaeus’ requires some

                            himself. Perhaps the only alteration which is absolutely demanded is at
                            iv. 203–205. The lines there, as they stand, clearly interrupt the
                            sense, and are more in place either after 196 or after 218. The strong
                            line, <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                            after 183. It is possible that the conjecture which Ribbeck adopts from
                            Wagner, ‘absoluto iam opere in marginem illos versus a poeta coniectos
                            esse,’ may give the true explanation of the misplacement of the lines,
                            though this does not seem to apply to any other passage in the poem.
                            Such bold changes as those introduced by Ribbeck at ii. 35–46, and again
                            at iii. 120–122, are not required by the sense, and are condemned by
                            rhythmical considerations. The line 119, <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                            </div> is weak for the concluding line of the paragraph, which ends much
                            more naturally with that transposed from 122 to 99, <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                            after his real observations are finished. The paragraph of four lines,
                            Quare agite o proprios ... Taburnum, stands bald and bare in the
                            position Ribbeck assigns it, between 108 and 109. The minor changes for
                            the most part disturb old associations and throw no new light on the

                        Parks. The following extracts from the last-named work—a work which
                        combines thorough practical knowledge with true poetical feeling—support
                        the statement in the text: ‘All the methods, both natural and artificial, of
                        propagating trees are described in graphic language. Virgil also fully
                        describes the self-sowing of trees, artificial sowing, propagating by
                        transplanting of suckers, propagating by pegging down the branches till they
                        strike root at the point of contact with the earth, and propagating by
                        simply cutting off a small branch from the top and placing it in the moist
                        warm earth. All these are correct. Indeed, the art is little advanced since
                        the time of Virgil,’ p. 46. Mr. Menzies suggests an ingenious explanation of
                        Virgil’s mistake as to what trees could be grafted on one another. In
                        speaking of the Aeneid he bears further testimony to the accuracy of
                        Virgil’s observation: ‘The poet was equally great and observant of the
                        details of woodcraft, and must have watched keenly the details of the
                        foresters around him,’ p. 50. This remark reminds us of the fact that one of
                        his father’s means of livelihood was ‘silvis coemendis.’ At p. 53 Mr.
                        Menzies draws special attention to the description of the mistletoe in Book
                        vi, and of the aged elm under which the Shades are described as

                        attuned to Latin than to Greek and English poetry. Goethe, in his ‘Letters
                        from Italy,’ mentions, on coming to the Lago di Garda, that he was reminded
                        of the line, <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-left: 1.80em; margin-top: 0.90em">

                        </div> He adds this remark: ‘This is the first Latin verse, the subject of
                        which ever stood visibly before me, and now, in the present moment, when the
                        wind is blowing stronger and stronger, and the lake casts loftier billows

                                contrast was suggested by Mr. Nettleship’s interpretation of the
                                character of Turnus (‘Suggestions,’ etc., pp. 15 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>). As will appear later, I am inclined to think
                                that he insists too exclusively on the ‘violentia,’ which is
                                undoubtedly a strong element in the character of the Italian hero.
                                The antagonism of Turnus to Aeneas, as of the Italians to the
                                Trojans, he justly regards as an instance of the strife of passion
                                with law. If the Greek drama suggested the ethical aspect of this
                                strife, a comparison with Horace, Ode iii. 4, of which Ode the
                                leading idea is the superiority of the ‘vis temperata’ over the ‘vis
                                consili expers,’ as illustrated in the wars of the Olympian Gods
                                with the Titans, and in the triumph of Augustus over the elements of
                                disorder opposing him, suggests that the political inspiration of
